While you may lose some people, the kinds of people who are perturbed by intersectionality aren't the kinds of people who are willing to do the actual work required to achieve justice. Even worse, they may actively work to create a new reality that continues to oppress you and other people because it benefits them. \n\nExample: Let's say we are talking about feminism in the workplace, and my fellow white women are talking about the standard things (equal pay, maternity and paternity leave, opportunity for advancement, etc.). If I feel safe, I may mention how the dress code is written in such a way that makes me feel like I cannot wear my natural, Afrocentric hair to work. A good ally would realize that this is a component of my experience womanhood in the workplace that she did not consider and would welcome my input about how to make the workplace more inclusive regarding this issue. A bad ally say that (1) my natural hair is unprofessional and should be regulated in the workplace, (2) my issue with my hair is a black person problem, so this isn't the space to talk about it, or (3) she might feel threatened if I mention that she is privileged because she doesn't have to wear a wig or permanently damage her hair to be viewed as professional in the workplace. In a private conversation among sympathetic folks, I can explain myself and hopefully get through to a bad ally with help from good allies. If we are in a hostile environment, this can be seen as an opportunity for an non-ally to discredit me. Now, someone can say, \"I agree about equal pay for equal work, but I don't think your natural hair is presentable and Bad Ally A agrees with me and is a feminist, so I can't be racist or sexist.\"  Even worse, that bad ally may gang up on me with this person, i.e. \"Black women are always trying to make you feel bad about being white.\"\n\nThe good ally in this situation doesn't have to understand my discomfort regarding Eurocentric beauty standards or think that it is a big deal in order to at least give me the space to explain myself and the acknowledgement that my feelings are valid. That is the bare minimum. If we speak to a supervisor about our concerns, all she has to do is let me speak about my experience if she doesn't know much about it and make sure that the supervisor takes my concerns as seriously as any other member's in the coalition. \n\nBack to the original example with homophobia in the black community: I would argue that people who actually care about ending police brutality and the mass incarceration system would find other opportunities to do so if they actually felt unwelcome in certain spaces because of their homophobic views. Maybe a more religious group? Personally, I would hope that people who hold harmful views are challenged a lot, so they understand that their thinking is not above reproach. It's too easy to think that if most people I know think like me that we must be right. \n\nPersonally, I think activism doesn't hold people accountable enough and that is why we accept these partial advances as \"enough\". It is hard to acknowledge that as rotten as this system is, we all benefit from it somehow, and we all must be willing to give up some privileges in order for equality or equity to be realized. Intersectional activism forces people to reckon with the fact that they can be the oppressed and the oppressor at the same time. It is uncomfortable and scary but absolutely necessary. I will concede that it is messier than just getting back whatever the dominant voices decide are the most important issues, but I think the tension and conflict within the movement is valuable because we have seen marginalized groups feel empowered to speak up. These views have always been there, but now people are now speaking forcefully, and the powerful are listening to some degree. The balance of power is shifting, and some people aren't going to like that. Sound familiar? ",

The best argument so far has been [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2ygdlk/cmv_im_a_man_who_finds_mra_more_irritating_than/cp9tyaf?context=3), and \"Just wait, MRA is still in its infancy, it'll bring about positive changes eventually\" seems to be the consensus among the sane responders. Everyone else is just doing the usual blaming of women and feminism for all of men's troubles and for why men haven't been able to improve other men's lives. Since I don't have the patience to read through any more posts insulting me for not acknowledging the problems men face (despite me doing so twice in the very first paragraphs of this post) I'll leave it at this: I'll respect MRAs when they do something to actually make my life as a man, or the lives of other men, better. Until then, the ones I meet seem to be doing more harm than good.\n\nThanks for all of you that gave an actual effort, and those of you that gave some food for thought regarding the shift in public perception that might come with a new generaton of MRAs.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

I have read all the CMV threads about cultural appropriation before, and none of the arguments have succeeded in changing my view. I recognize that some people find culture appropriation offensive, and therefore would not partake in it myself, but I really see no harm in using another culture as costume. I happen to be Asian, and would take no offense at all to people dressed up with slanty eyes or speaking with broken english or making fun of my penis size or saying that we all look the same, or applying any Asian country's stereotype to me despite me not being from that country.  \n\nThe main definition and argument of it seems to be that it is the result of the identity of an oppressed culture being used by a non oppressed culture. I want to keep this mostly around appropriating costume as that is what I am most interested in.\n\nWhy is this wrong? Are we not capable of seeing things in context, and seeing the difference between college students at a music festival wearing Native American Headdress and real Native Americans wearing them as symbols of valor? \n\nBlackface is offensive because of oppressive origins and the continued racial struggles that black people face today? We have comedians that engage in incredibly dark humour regarding racism or abuse or rape or murder as well but they don't have nearly as much backlash as cultural appropriation. People who are offended or triggered by the content can choose not to watch, although I may be opening a different can of worms here and perhaps I need a CMV as to why offensive humour is wrong as well.\n\nI just can't see why we should keep culture off limits when it is done without malicious intent. \n\n\n**View changed Edit: There are some parts that I still don't understand or agree with, but I think the overarching theme is pretty clear to me now.**\n\nThere has been a lot of regurgitation of the same thing without explanation, but one point that a few people made finally drove it home for me. It would really help if you answer the question being provided rather than just defining the question in different words because that doesn't help change a person's view at all. I discussed with people at work and former peers in school, and the discussion looked like this a lot of the time\n\n\"why is cultural appropriation is wrong?\"\n\"Because it is wrong! can't you see that??\"\n\"Yes i see the premise but why is it wrong?\"\n\"Because you are stealing someone else's culture!\"\n\nAnyway, here is what I now understand.\n\n**The condemnation of Cultural appropriation is like a company defending its trademark.**\n\nYou may think the apple logo is pretty neat, and start putting it on all your things. People may start thinking the same way as you and start putting it on their mugs and bags and furniture as well. Of course not everyone can make their own, so they look for ways to purchase items with the apple logo already on it. People start selling premade apple logo products, they start wearing apple hats to music festivals. The real Apple is not seeing money out of this, nor are they selling these products because they are about technology. They could make a lot of money selling these products, but their brand philosophy is about tech and it would take a huge restructuring and hiring of new people to make a shift in what they sell. While you or I may not be bothered or offended or see it as wrong, of course Apple is going to have a problem because they are losing brand recognition and people are making money off of something they created. So they sue the people trying to sell apple products and say the apple logo can only be applied to things by them otherwise it is illegitimate. Replace apple logo with any cultural symbol and it is the same point, of course a culture cannot sue individuals for appropriation so they will defend their brand through condemning those who do through social constructs.\n\n~~IF you believe that a company has the right to do this, then you should also believe cultural appropriation is wrong. IF you think people should be able to use logos any way they want, then cultural appropriation is not wrong.~~  I do not think this is clear enough anymore. My basic premise is that cultural appropriation is not wrong but neither is trying to stop others from doing it. Neither side is out of line.\n\nHOWEVER, when it comes to the racist argument, or that only minority groups can experience cultural appropriation if it is by a majority (white people) group I am still not convinced. Blackface is not cultural appropriation, you can never dilute the meaning of skin tone. Years of oppression are not invalidated, unless you personally believe they are, and that is your prerogative. I will continue to understand the struggles of slavery and oppression while simultaneously enjoying a comedy sketch making fun of black stereotypes, while others can believe that the comedy sketch completely invalidates decades of progression. We will forever disagree on this point and that is fine with me as I think I have a deeper understanding of the whole concept.\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV!

Secondly, there's a difference between a mental illness and a condition. Something like bipolar is a mental illness. Autism isn't an illness as much as it's a way your brain works. It's useful to be able to classify autistic people not to say they're broken, but to legitimize the fact that they may function differently in society.\n\n>There is a stigma, rightfully so, against people with mental disorders. People with mental disorder diagnosis don't need to be shunned but recognized as a problem (implicitly) that can be monitored/attempted to be cured. It's just the definition.\n\nThere is a big difference between recognizing mental illness as a problem and recognizing mentally ill *people* as a problem. Mentally ill people are not a problem. They have an illness that affects their ability to function, and that illness needs to be treated in whatever ways we can to improve their quality of life. But stigma does exactly the opposite. Stigmatizing mentally ill people makes them people to fear and avoid instead of people to understand and have empathy for.\n\n>What if great minds in the past were autistic and if you were to raise them as mentally ill that they wouldn't have been able to flourish in such a productive way? If we start treating people who are odd (level 1 ASD) as wrong, I believe that, in general society, will tend to a homogenized, uncreative being.\n\nYour argument seems to be that \"mentally ill people are dysfunctional, so we shouldn't label functional people as mentally ill.\" The problem is with the idea that mentally ill people are (all) dysfunctional to begin with. There lots of space between \"completely dysfunctional\" and \"completely neurotypical.\" Autistic people fall in this space. Classifying autism as a mental disorder or condition allows autistic people to receive the support they need *instead* of classifying them as dysfunctional.\n\nThink of it like we think of dyslexia. Before we had a term for it, dyslexic kids were just thought to be stupid. You can't read, you're dumb. But now we know that dyslexia is a real condition you can have and has no bearing on your intelligence, just your ability to read easily. So now we can develop fonts that mitigate the effects of dyslexia. We can encourage dyslexic kids to experience literature through audiobooks. We can give them extra time on tests so their grades reflect what they know instead of how long it takes them to read the question. Autism and aspergers are the same way. Instead of \"that kid flaps his hands because he's stupid/weird/uncontrollable,\" we can say \"that kid flaps his hands because he's autistic and it helps him think.\"\n\nUltimately, the solution isn't to get rid of labels, it's to remove the stigma surrounding those labels.",

I thought it was rude and presumptuous to think they knew better and had some right to bother me about their religious convictions. \n\nAs I got a little older and came to understand religion a bit better I had a revelation. They are behaving this way because they believe it to be true. This doesn't sound like much of a revelation, but when properly applied it changes your entire interpretation of why people do what they do. \n\nThe door knockers really and truly believe that they need to save my soul, and to do so knocking on my door and trying to talk is a good idea. Let me be clear here, my revelation was not about door knockers, it was about people. \n\n**Beliefs drive behaviours**\n\nNow I don't know any good ways of seeing someone's beliefs directly other than asking, but a reasonably good shortcut is to start by listening to the person and then looking at their peers in behaviour. What group did he align himself with?ISIS. What religion? Islam. And what behaviours are common in those groups? All the same behaviours he had. So there seems to be a correlation, and figuring out the direction is important. \n\nDo people who hate gays become Islamic? Do they change religion because of their hatred? If so, the hate is the cause and the religion is the consequence. But I don't think this is the case. I think that Islam holds these toxic ideals and the hate grows from that. I see people who live in Islamic countries holding these bigoted positions and bringing them with them when they move to the west. I see people taking on the faith in the west and then developing the hatred just the same as those who grew up in it. I see people who would never raise a hand to hurt another person say they don't support ISIS but I check the name of their imam and it turns out that the imam does, and so their tithing goes to support Wahhabi doctrine. \n\nSo do I think this guy was mentally ill? Maybe, but by what standard? Soldiers do terrible things in war, are they mentally ill? Sure, compared to a person in a peaceful society they appear mentally ill, but that is not how they see it. From their perspective this is a war, a struggle for control of the Earth, and this was a wartime action, an act of violence in support of that cause. I think that shows that it is more reasonable to interpret his actions as motivated by religion rather than a personal mental illness. ",

I guess we should just stop selling all cultural items.  Even if the market (i.e. the people) want to purchase them.  \n\nHow exactly is it harmful?  Can you articulate the actual harm being done?  Or is just a mental harm?  It's like the Washington Redskins.  Polls show the only people actually offended are not the natives but the progressive white people suffering from white guilt.  Its honestly laughable.\n\n>Because context is important. If you're someone who knows and respects a culture then you're probably not going to use it for a cheap buck.

Not wanting children pretty much proves that you don&#39;t have the deep down need to reproduce, right?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, it just shows that not everyone has these needs as you do not want everyone in a society to be constantly reproducing. You want some people to be focused on hunting, or fighting, or whatever. The fact that some people are gay and that homosexuality is found in many species shows that you it differs between people. </p>\n\n<p>So imagine a gay horse. They exist, totally natural. That horse doesn&#39;t want to reproduce because it is designed to not be attracted to reproducing. Does that mean no horse has the animal desire to reproduce? Why are humans different?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are they? Why?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve explained this several times, you haven&#39;t explained why they arent</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>No. That&#39;s also not what I&#39;m proposing. There are some basic factors that play a role in how well off your children will probably be. A big factor there is your income. If you don&#39;t even have enough income to provide for the child, you don&#39;t fulfill the basic criteria to take care of a child. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This makes me feel physically sick to read, but ill get past that. Youre saying that poor people are inherently unable to take care of a child. </p>\n\n<p>But wait, you just said that you&#39;re not proposing that all poor people are bad parents.</p>\n\n<p>So which is it, poor people are capable of raising healthy children, or poor people are incapable of taking care of their child?</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "This isn't really \"evidence\" but reading your post I know what you mean and I wanted to share my experience with a control freak egomaniac that may change your view. I have a boss who is very egotistical and paranoid and a bit of a control freak. He thrives on conflict and drama, which is a similarity I see in Trump.\n\nExample of my boss and his control freakishness: He constantly monkey's with computer controlled staff schedules and dispatch systems just because he can. He's consumed by it. The staff schedule is auto-generated by the staff picking their preferred schedule then the computer goes down the list in seniority order: person with most seniority, you get your top schedule preference. 2nd gets his if it doesn't conflict with choice of person higher in seniority. 3rd, same, on down the crew of 15 people. He'll come back and say \"I need more people on Saturday than the computer says, so you and you don't get what you picked, you do what I say now.\" Example two: We are a crew of repair people dispatched across DFW, the system will give you the next high priority tickets regardless of how far away, then if no high priority tickets exist at that moment in time then it gives you the ticket closest to your GPS coords. He'll mess that up all day long and give you something that he thinks is closer because he doesn't think it's possible to meet a high priority ticket before it misses the due time leaving a high priority customer out in the wind and put off till tomorrow. Or sometimes he'll choose something that makes you drive a long way for no reason. Both situations create ongoing arguments and resentment with his subordinates. When things don't work out he'll blame the computer system or the employee involved. Never himself.\n\nConflict: He thrives in conflict and continually does and says things to create drama. This is where he reminds me of Trump the most. He doesn't do it for the 'lols' as you are suggesting, although it seems like it. My best example of that with my boss: one day a customer from the day before that I fixed called in a second ticket. My boss was upset and wanted me and a co-worker to go out there and meet him there. I got there with my co-worker and everything was up and working according to our mobile tablets where we run tests on internet, video and phone systems, what I fixed yesterday was still fixed on the line on the outside of the house. Hey, sometimes customers just don't get it, user error, and they call again and the phone jockeys just dispatch another ticket to the field instead of working with the difficult customer. It happens. But then my boss showed up all aggressive \"Explain to me what you did yesterday.\" Two sentences in he interrupts my explanation that there is nothing broken today \"Nah, I don't want to hear that. You need to explain why this customer called again.\" I then said, but my co-worker Bob is my witness, nothing was broken again, I don't know why the customer called again, we haven't talked to them yet. \"I don't want to hear what Bob says, he's a liar like you.\"\n\nI am stunned into silence. After frowning at him with shocked anger and watching a grin slowly appear on his face, I finally said \"Now we have a different problem. Why do you think I'm a liar?\" he starts to back pedal \"Nah, Nah, Nah, we need to talk to this customer about why he called a second time.\" - I say \"NO. We have a serious problem I need cleared up according to our company's code of ethical conduct. You just called me a liar. You just called Bob a liar. Before we go or do anything else, I require an explanation. Why are we lairs?\" I wasn't yelling, it was nothing but stern anger in my voice. He has a long pause as he squints a sideways glance at me \"Come on man. I was just playin'. Let's just go talk to this customer, make sure he's ok.\" He walks to the customer's door who finally saw 3 phone trucks outside and was all \"We're here to double check on the service we provide. Jaeldi was here yesterday and I know he did an excellent job of getting the line repaired, blah blah blah.\" Everything is fine with the customer and they think my boss is a swell guy going out of his way to make sure everything is ok. \n\nAnd that's the Jeckle and Hide moment. When faced with a situation that looks like he's not going to win, he's going to lose badly, he totally dismisses his crazy outlandish accusations and proceeds like it never happened or was all just a joke. He wasn't planning on a joke. He was planning on a conflict, a battle to win, to stoke his ego. When that wasn't going to happen, he slid over to another perspective that dismisses it all. \n\nAnd this is what I think Trump does. He's all self centered Ego just like my boss. But he's not dumb, he's very intelligent. But that ego ruins his intelligence badly. The intelligence will save him from the utter collapse when balloons pop. Jump over to another balloon. Float along on that conflict and drama. They'll always be another balloon. They'll always be another loser to lord over.\n\nTo be a total nerd, I am reminded of Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Kahn when in the Battle in the Mutara Nebula speaking of Kahn, Spock says \"He is intelligent, but his actions demonstrate he lacks experience\". For my boss and Trump I would alter that statement slightly: He is intelligent, but his actions demonstrate a lack of self awareness of his own ego and an emotional need for conflict and drama. He has to feel like he's winning and someone else is losing or is a loser or he feels insecure. \n\nIt can be pretty unsettling being around someone that does outlandish things that defy common sense but it is all Ego, not a planned joke, running that engine. \n\nSorry that was so long.

It would have been best to not be sick.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I\u2019m unfamiliar with which countries have chattel slavery, if you could point me to them. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a 50/50 chance on every single core value and belief you have that you are wrong and trying to push a false agenda.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nope, that\u2019s what ethical consistency is. Please explain how there is a 50/50 chance slavery is right. Someone haven\u2019t a different opinion doesn\u2019t make me wrong and them right. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>1/4 of my work life is slavery for the government.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is so not chattel slavery. You have a freedom of choice, of existence, that chattel slavery denies people. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Should we try to convince people who are still pro slavery that they are wrong?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is still slavery other places so it&#39;s still accepted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But that\u2019s not chattel slavery. That\u2019s what I had intended to express, so I\u2019m revising my statement to be more precise. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So whose to say that it doesn&#39;t fluctuate and in a hundred years society will be pro slavery again?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even if it is, unless you are a cultural relativist, that doesn\u2019t make it right. </p>\n\n<p>I specifically talked about the ethics of slavery. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I hope we can get into this more and I&#39;m all for saying you changed my view</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I\u2019m down for that, but you need to actually grapple with my points and not give me a 50% chance of being wrong simply because there are 2 sides. Ethics is not flipping a coin. </p>\n</div>",

If they did the exact same thing, wouldn&#39;t you get the same result?</p>\n\n<p>In real life, every case is different.  Obviously one of the punchers hit the dead guy in just the right spot and killed him and the other puncher didn&#39;t.  I&#39;m touched by your sympathy for the guy who killed someone, but it&#39;s also sucks to be killed.  People who punch people are assuming lots of risk, like getting beat up, getting in trouble, even death.  And under the law, you are assuming that risk if you choose to punch someone, and you should know that because the fact you may not doesn&#39;t mean shit.  </p>\n\n<p>And you think you hate the law over this dumb shit?

Reading is a great way to work on that. </p>\n\n<p>it&#39;s*\nyou&#39;re*\nmisattributed* \nMark Twain*</p>\n\n<p>Or, more likely you&#39;ll ignore this because instead of accepting that you are wrong, you&#39;d rather laugh it off and pretend like you don&#39;t care. Or that this was a fluke.</p>\n\n<p>But it wasn&#39;t a fluke, was it? I read some of your other comments, hoping you were just having a rough day. Nope, you are just a negative person. Quick to be cruel but never considerate. You attack people instead of their arguments. You make it personal. Why? I don&#39;t know. But it&#39;s sad, man. Get your shit together.</p>\n\n<p>PM me a throwaway google account if you&#39;d like the book. Seems like Twain is exactly who you need to catch up with. And when you see I&#39;m right, you don&#39;t even have to say anything. We&#39;ll both just know. </p>\n\n<p>Outtie.</p>\n</div>",

At the temperature of jet fuel, the steel would be less than half as strong as it is cold. That, combined with the force of impact, and the thermal expansion, fatally compromised the structure.\n\nYou (and really every explanation Ive ever read) neglects a huge effect:  Heat transfer.  Im not sure why most explanations forego the modeling of heat transver, but it is a HUGE red flag in every 9/11 explanation (official or unofficial) that I have ever seen.\n\nThe fact that Jet fuel burns at (whatever) degrees is really irrelevant. The issue is getting the heat energy from the fireball to the structure that is to be heated (steel in this case).  When the plane hit the tower, the jet fuel exploded in a huge fireball.  Most of the heat in the jet fuel went into heating the AIR surrounding the tower, as well as the few floors the tower hit.  Some of it must have sprayed/burned onto the core columns, but to raise the temperature of the core columns to the fuel's burning temperature would require a STEADY and CONSTANT supply of fuel.  Why?  Because it takes time for things to change temperature.  If you don't believe me, please google \"Heat Transfer\".  Hint:  Its why you dont get a burn if you touch a pot of boiling water for a split second, but you will if you touch it for longer.\n\nNow lets look at a simple energy calculation, and assume the WORST POSSIBLE case scenario, which checks the claim that the steel was weakened due to the high heat.  And I mean worst case:  I am going to assume all energy from fuel goes into heating the buildings steel, and not heating the air/furniture/concrete/office supplies: \n\nLets assume you took the **fuel contained in a fully loaded 767 (152616.46L)**, and painted it evenly across EACH AND EVERY steel column that supported the WTC (since all of the columns came tumbling down, not just the parts that were hit by the plane/fireball).\n\n**Jet feul has an energy density of 35MJ/L**, giving the tank a chemical potential energy of **5.3415761E12 Joules.**  **Steel has a specific heat capacity of 450 J/(KG*degree_C)**\n\nNow, we light the steel and burn the fuel.  Now, even assuming that ALL the energy in the fuel went into heating the metal and none went into heating the air (obviously not true but since this is a \"worst-possible\" case), this would heat up the structural steel:\n\n5.3415761E12 Joules/(450J/(KG degree_C) x 181436948KG) = **65.4 degrees C**\n\nNot nearly enough to weaken the beams.\n\nBut what about the kinetic energy of the plane, you ask?  It is quite irrelevant given the amount of energy in the fuel.  But just for completeness:\n\nMass of 767 (maximum possible takeoff weight):  **179168.986KG**\n\nVelocity: **500mph** (this would be impossible at 1500ft above ground because the dense air would tear the plane apart, but again, assuming the worst)\n\nThis adds an extra **4475747911.66J** of energy.  Assuming the plane disintegrated itself and its kinetic energy evenly distributed itself across the steel (again, sugn a ridiculous assumption, but \"worst case\"), the new change in temp of the steel would be:\n\n(5.3415761E12+4475747911.66)/(450J/(KG degree_C) x 181436948) = **65.5 degrees C**\n\nNow this was the absolute worst case scenario, assuming many things for the sake of trying to prove the official theory that the steel was weakened.  This still isn't what actually happened, so don't call this a theory - it just disproves the ridiculous official theory.\n\nYou would probably tell me:  The Fuel exploded across only a few floors - so there could have been sufficient heat transferred to the floors around the crash site to weaken the steel there.  Plus there were fires.  And this is absolutely true.  But then why didn't only the top of the building fall?  Why did the bottom 80+ floors also collapse - steel melted and concrete turned to dirt - if the jet fuel didnt \"weaken\" those areas?  \n\nIf your answer is that the impact of the plane made the building vibrate and weakened the steel you are wrong.  Impact damage (opposed to fatigue damage) is instant.  Furthermore, if the impact did hurt the structural integrity of the steel, you would see it as soon as the plane hit - that is, the building would have broken apart rigt away (likely at or below impact location, since the maximum stresses applied to the building by the impact occur at the impact location and near the base of the building; however we know without calculation that the pane has nowhere near enough momentum to generate the stresses needed to tear the building at its base).  But instantaneous collapse didn't happen, and the idea of something as (relatively) small as a plane traveling at a few hundred miles an hour breaking a bldg as big as the WTC is just stupid. I would even venture to say its impossible, since the plane body is not very strong compared to the building.\n\nFYI, I study failures of materials due to dynamic, static, or thermal loading.  I work in a research lab that analyzes material failures that start at the mollecular level and propagate through until the entire material cracks.  The tough part of failure analysis is understanding the forces/dynamics/heat exchange/electric flow of the atoms/mollecules that make up material we otherwise think of as solid.  After you know that, it is just simulating those forces and seeing what happens.  In the case of the WTC, the dynamics at play are readily known and available - everything is on such a large scale.  Coming from my background, it is very obvious that the WTC could not have been brought down by a plane and jet fuel.\n\nEDIT: /u/GonzotheGreat89 I see a lot of non-scientists in here.  I'm a material failure engineer, my posts are not regurgitation off of \"conspiracy\" sites or anything.  This shit is what I work on every day.  Feel free to ask anything else.",

Easy math tells us this is 250 J of energy, a negligible amount of thermal energy (less then the chemical energy your body can obtain from eating a tic-tac). What happens to your sample?\n\nYou are conflating two different failure mechanisms:  Failure by phase change (due to heat) and mechanical failure.  The point of my simple calculation was to point out that there was not enough heat energy to weaken the steel.  You are all of a sudden assuming that we are taking material damage into account.\n\nAnd since you seem to have such a poor scientific background but seem to want one, ill indulge your sledgehammer question:\n\nPause at the instant the hammer and sample contact, they will exert an equal and opposite force across their contact areas.  Normalize the force by the contact area, and you will realize the stress (at that instant) that is currently applied to both the sledgehammer and the sample.\n\nBut the sample/hammer each are not in equilibrium.  \n\nUnpause.  \n\nThe top surface of the sample has a currently stress applied to it.  That stress makes its way (compressing intermollecular bonds as it travels) to the bottom of the sample. \n\nAs the stress moves through the sample, the area it effects spreads (as the stress wave travels through the material) from the contact area through the sample.  If the Von Misses stress state (could probably be estimated as a 1D stress state, since the stress tends to act in 1 direction) exceeds the yield strength of the material at any point while the stress wave is propagating through the sample, it will plastically (irrecoverably) deform.  This is what typically happens at the impact location, we see a dent where the hammer hit.  \n\nIf the stress wave exceeds the ultimate strength of the sample, then we have...how did you say  \"Crunch\".\n\nAssuming no Crunch, the shockwave will traverse the entire sameple.

That&#39;s kind of what happens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not if the dominos are stacked one on top of the other.  Your analogy is correct if the building were sideways, and the core columns would be beside one beside another instead of one on top of another.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>BECAUSE 20 STORIES OF BUILDING FELL ON THEM?!?  I mean... that&#39;s kind of a bit of a shock load...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They did not fall on the bottom 80 stories.  They were already resting on top of them, in static equilibrium (albeit with floors on fire).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sooooo Mr. Materials Scientist, a sledgehammer weighing 5 kg is swung at 10 m/s at your sample. Easy math tells us this is 250 J of energy, a negligible amount of thermal energy (less then the chemical energy your body can obtain from eating a tic-tac). What happens to your sample?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You are conflating two different failure mechanisms:  Failure by phase change (due to heat) and mechanical failure.  The point of my simple calculation was to point out that there was not enough heat energy to weaken the steel.  You are all of a sudden assuming that we are taking material damage into account.</p>\n\n<p>And since you seem to have such a poor scientific background but seem to want one, ill indulge your sledgehammer question:</p>\n\n<p>Pause at the instant the hammer and sample contact, they will exert an equal and opposite force across their contact areas.  Normalize the force by the contact area, and you will realize the stress (at that instant) that is currently applied to both the sledgehammer and the sample.</p>\n\n<p>But the sample/hammer each are not in equilibrium.  </p>\n\n<p>Unpause.  </p>\n\n<p>The top surface of the sample has a currently stress applied to it.  That stress makes its way (compressing intermollecular bonds as it travels) to the bottom of the sample. </p>\n\n<p>As the stress moves through the sample, the area it effects spreads (as the stress wave travels through the material) from the contact area through the sample.  If the Von Misses stress state (could probably be estimated as a 1D stress state, since the stress tends to act in 1 direction) exceeds the yield strength of the material at any point while the stress wave is propagating through the sample, it will plastically (irrecoverably) deform.  This is what typically happens at the impact location, we see a dent where the hammer hit.  </p>\n\n<p>If the stress wave exceeds the ultimate strength of the sample, then we have...how did you say  &quot;Crunch&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming no Crunch, the shockwave will traverse the entire sameple.  As teh wave reflects off of the back of the sample, the sample will store potential energy in the form of vibration, at any of its natural frequencies for which the shockwave has energy content.</p>\n\n<p>Quite simple.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please do not bother responding, you have already shown you are no scientist.

If we get right down to it we can't know that we're not, say, living in some sort of computer simulation; if that's the case the \"real\" world could be anything you could imagine with any sort of arbitrary physics and rules. Nothing (with perhaps the exception of math and logic) can be known for sure. But, that makes for a boring argument. So let's start with the premise that reality exists and is pretty much how we observe it. Not too much to ask, right?\n\nThe first thing you'll realize when you start thinking about this is that to have a non-zero chance of dying you have to live forever. We're not talking about just living indefinitely long, replacing organs as you go and whatnot, but instead I should be able to name any time in the future and you'll still be around. Let's take a look at what that will take. \n\n**100 years**: I'll assume you're in your early twenties right now so I have a number to work with. The longest living person that I'm aware of was [Jeanne Calment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Calment) who lived to the age of 122. So, if you want to live another 100 years, you could maybe do it just with good genes and good luck. We're only looking for a non-zero chance, so we're doing good so far. \n\n**200 years**: Congratulations! You've lived another 200 years and managed to break all records of human lifespan previously known. To get to this point unprecedented medical advances have been made. New organs can be grown replaced as you need them, and methods have been devised to keep your brain cells healthy, or at least to replace them bit by bit. Or maybe you do get a brain replacement every now and then, but your old memories, personality, intelligence, etc. are imprinted on it. Would that still count as you? For the sake of argument let's say sure, why not. \n\nAlmost as important as the advances in medical technology is your access to it. Perhaps this tech is available only to the rich and influential, or maybe it's so cheap and easy everyone can use it. In any case, you've managed to discover the fountain of youth, and you have a long life ahead of you.\n\n**10,000 years**: A lot has changed in your lifetime. You're one of the oldest humans alive, having been lucky enough to be in the first generation that had access to effective immortality. Aging and disease are distant memories. You've managed to live through the strife caused by the end of death. Perhaps that elixir of immortality is available to only a select few, or perhaps humanity has spread beyond Earth to cope with an ever-growing population, or maybe childbirth is strictly controlled. Whatever happened society lives on, and you with it. \n\n**100,000 years**: You've managed to go a thousand centuries without your head getting crushed under the back wheels of a bus. Kudos. \n\n**1,000,000 years**: A million years. Wow. How much memory can the human mind hold, anyway? Do you remember your childhood, your first kiss, the face of your parents? Perhaps you have some sort of external memory. How recognizable would you be now to yourself in the year 2013AD? Are you still human, even? Whatever you are, let's say that you're still you, and you've lived this long. \n\nYou've seen the rise and fall of countless civilizations. Most of human history is in your mind. The invention of agriculture and the city happened a mere 10,000 years before you were born; at this point, that's pretty much a rounding error in your age. \n\n**10^9 years**: The Earth is about 5.54 billion years old now. You've been around for 18% of that. When you were born there had been five major mass extinction events in Earth's history. Has another one happened by now? Perhaps a giant comet or meteor has struck the Earth in your lifetime, shrouding it in a cloud of debris that blocked the sun. Maybe a nearby star went super nova and bathed the Earth in gamma radiation, driving you and everyone else underground. Whatever has or hasn't happened, humanity must have god-like technology by now for you to have survived this long. We're definitely in the realm of science fiction now, but you said 100% certainty, so why not? \n\n**3 x 10^9 years**: The Milky Way and the nearby Andromeda galaxy merge. You've seen Andromeda grow in the night sky from the little smudge it is today to a giant, sky filling wonder. Don't worry, galaxies are mostly empty space, so it's very unlikely that our sun will be hit by another star. You and whoever else is around will have to think of a name for the new galaxy that forms. \n\n**5 x 10^9 years**: You're about half as old as the Earth now and the sun is dying. As it burns through its hydrogen fuel it begins to fuse helium and heavier elements. The sun expands and swallows up the planet Mercury, then Venus. You had better hope that there was a well funded space program sometime in the last few billion years because Earth is not a fun place right now. The oceans have boiled away and the surface is a scorched desert, to say the least. At noon the giant, red sun fills the entire sky from horizon to horizon. Hopefully you've invested in a nice retirement home on Europa. \n\n(continued)\n",

Has the problem of traveling faster than light ever been solved? Can you zip between stars with your warp drive, or do you just accept that trip will take a while? You've certainly got the time to travel, and if you're going at relativistic speeds it doesn't even seem to take that long to you. By now lots of good books have likely been written, so hopefully you'll have something to keep yourself busy on your voyages between stars. \n\n**10^11 years**: The galaxies in the Local Group begin to merge together into one giant galaxy. Guess you'll have to come up with yet another galaxy name. \n\n**10^12 years**: Half-Life 3 is released. It doesn't live up to your expectations. \n\n**2 x 10^12 years**: Remember how you had to keep coming up with galaxy names? Well, the universe is constantly expanding and all other galaxies have receded beyond the edge of the observable universe. So, since there's only galaxy sitting in the middle of a black emptiness that stretches billions of light years in each direction it seems kind of redundant to bother naming it. When you meet new alien lifeforms and civilizations you try to tell them that the universe used to be full of galaxies just like the one you're in now, but it seems a little farfetched to them. \n\n**3 x 10^12 years**: You and whatever's left of humanity and the other races you've met clearly have amazing powers to have lasted this long. You may as well get a hobby. Why not find a planet with primitive intelligent life and convince them you're God? Get a few friends together and get followers on different continents, and see whose worshipers dominate the world. Best RTS ever. \n\n**10^14 years**: Star formation ceases. The stars that currently exist burn out one by one, leaving dimly glowing dwarf stars, fast spinning pulsars, black holes, etc. The night sky (assuming you're even on a planet right now) grows darker with each passing aeon as the stars wink out of existence. You've been around a long time, and you start to feel an emotion you almost forgot the existence of; an existential fear of your ultimate fate. \n\n**10^15 years**: You're having a hard time finding a welcoming planet. The ones that haven't fallen into their parent stars have been flung into interstellar space, drifting forever in the cold darkness. Perhaps you and what's left of the other intelligent races have undertaken a massive engineering project to keep the light of life burning in a dying universe. You and the others build an artificial star at the centre of a Dyson sphere, a solar system sized construct surrounding your new sun. This is the last bastion of civilization and intelligent life, a flickering candle in the infinite darkness. Memories of everything and everyone that ever was is stored in vast libraries. You and the other immortals try to discover new physics to stave off the inevitable. \n\n**10^18 years**: You stare into the abyss, wondering if there are other bastions of civilization like yours that exist beyond the edge of the observable universe. \n\n**10^20 years**: Similar to the fate of the planets, stellar remnants are flung from the galaxy or begin falling into black holes. The One Galaxy grows smaller and denser, increasing the speed of this process. You and the Immortals are mindful of this and carefully plot the trajectory of your home. Perhaps you're somehow finding fuel for it to keep the star at its centre burning, or maybe you have to keep making new ones. As the last galaxy dies, you're concerned that you can't keep this up forever. You continue your study of physics; no new discoveries have been made in aeons, but you keep looking for loop-holes in the laws of nature that might save you. Many others have decided this is futile and have accepted their fate, leaving your collective to drift lifeless among the remains of the stars. You press on. \n\n**10^40 years**: You know protons, one of the subatomic particles that (along with neutrons and electrons) make up the atoms and molecules of all matter that you interact with? Most of them are gone by now, having decayed away in a slow but inevitable process. All regular matter that's left is a rare resource. If you've somehow, miraculously, against all odds made it to this point, you're most likely alone. Everything is cold, dark, empty, unforgiving. \n\n**10^100 years**: All that's left in the universe is you (somehow) and black holes. How are you even still alive? The vast majority of your existence, so much so that everything else is barely even worth mentioning, has just been you floating in darkness with nothing but black holes for company. Even they are starting to vanish as they evaporate through Hawking radiation, shrinking in mass and then winking out of existence. \n\n**Beyond**: There are still some photons, electrons, and other things flying about, but the universe is so vast and empty that they hardly ever interact with each other. It's uncertain what the future holds at this point, but you won't be around to see it. Some of the electrons that were once part of you are still around I suppose, somewhere, but it's impossible at this point that anything that could be considered \"you\" could remain. Perhaps other universes exist or will come into existence, and if there are an infinity of them then some entity very much like you could very will exist in them, but the \"you\" that you are now will be gone, irrecoverably, forever. The light of life in the universe has guttered and been extinguished. \n\n**tl;dr: Maybe you can beat cancer and AIDS and aging and go live among the stars, but you'll never escape entropy.**\n\nEdit: This has been linked in a couple of places and is generating a lot of interesting discussion.

You and the others build an artificial star at the centre of a Dyson sphere, a solar system sized construct surrounding your new sun. This is the last bastion of civilization and intelligent life, a flickering candle in the infinite darkness. Memories of everything and everyone that ever was is stored in vast libraries. You and the other immortals try to discover new physics to stave off the inevitable. </p>\n\n<p><strong>10<sup>18</sup> years</strong>: You stare into the abyss, wondering if there are other bastions of civilization like yours that exist beyond the edge of the observable universe. </p>\n\n<p><strong>10<sup>20</sup> years</strong>: Similar to the fate of the planets, stellar remnants are flung from the galaxy or begin falling into black holes. The One Galaxy grows smaller and denser, increasing the speed of this process. You and the Immortals are mindful of this and carefully plot the trajectory of your home. Perhaps you&#39;re somehow finding fuel for it to keep the star at its centre burning, or maybe you have to keep making new ones. As the last galaxy dies, you&#39;re concerned that you can&#39;t keep this up forever. You continue your study of physics; no new discoveries have been made in aeons, but you keep looking for loop-holes in the laws of nature that might save you. Many others have decided this is futile and have accepted their fate, leaving your collective to drift lifeless among the remains of the stars. You press on. </p>\n\n<p><strong>10<sup>40</sup> years</strong>: You know protons, one of the subatomic particles that (along with neutrons and electrons) make up the atoms and molecules of all matter that you interact with? Most of them are gone by now, having decayed away in a slow but inevitable process. All regular matter that&#39;s left is a rare resource. If you&#39;ve somehow, miraculously, against all odds made it to this point, you&#39;re most likely alone. Everything is cold, dark, empty, unforgiving. </p>\n\n<p><strong>10<sup>100</sup> years</strong>: All that&#39;s left in the universe is you (somehow) and black holes. How are you even still alive? The vast majority of your existence, so much so that everything else is barely even worth mentioning, has just been you floating in darkness with nothing but black holes for company. Even they are starting to vanish as they evaporate through Hawking radiation, shrinking in mass and then winking out of existence. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Beyond</strong>: There are still some photons, electrons, and other things flying about, but the universe is so vast and empty that they hardly ever interact with each other. It&#39;s uncertain what the future holds at this point, but you won&#39;t be around to see it. Some of the electrons that were once part of you are still around I suppose, somewhere, but it&#39;s impossible at this point that anything that could be considered &quot;you&quot; could remain. Perhaps other universes exist or will come into existence, and if there are an infinity of them then some entity very much like you could very will exist in them, but the &quot;you&quot; that you are now will be gone, irrecoverably, forever. The light of life in the universe has guttered and been extinguished. </p>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr: Maybe you can beat cancer and AIDS and aging and go live among the stars, but you&#39;ll never escape entropy.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Edit: This has been linked in a couple of places and is generating a lot of interesting discussion. Since I can&#39;t really respond to everyone I&#39;d just like to say here that I thank everyone for their kind words and I&#39;m really glad that so many people are enjoying this and the discussion around it. </p>\n\n<p>More info:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://filer.case.edu/dts8/thelastq.htm\">The Last Question</a> by Isaac Asimov is a wonderful short story that has been linked to by a few users in response to this. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe\">Wiki page</a> on the ultimate fate of the universe. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/1doki2/sahasrahla_describes_your_life_as_an_immortal/\">DepthHub</a> discussion.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1doohs/sahasrahla_explains_why_true_immortality_is/\">BestOf</a> discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Classic <a href=\"http://thefutureofourworld.ytmnd.com/\">ytmnd</a> on the future of the world.</p>\n\n<p>Also remember to check out the rest of the responses and discussion about the original CMV by <a href=\"/u/paulogy\">/u/paulogy</a></p>\n\n<p>Cheers.</p>\n</div>",

The military refuses to hire tons of people for different reasons which is not discrimination, since serving in the military is *not a right*. People with lots of different mental disorders are turned away, for example people with severe depression, but saying that it's \"anti-depression discrimination\" would be silly. It's freakin' common sense that people who present a higher risk than others are not allowed to serve. Trans people are in this category, it is a known fact that they are prone to suicide and depression, they are a risk to their peers in the military. If you think Trump just cooked up this idea because he hates trans people you're just being malicious.\n\n> you believe that it should be okay to fire gay people for being gay\n\nI don't think anyone should be fired for this specific reason but as far as I know what has been going on for decades now is that many employers hired LGBT people fulfilling quotas and cis-hetero people got fired for it. (The first example that comes to mind is the BBC and I know that's in the UK, but it happened in the US as well.) People who didn't raise their voice then should keep their mouths shut now, if what you say is true at all.\n\n> and you support the same dictatorships that Trump supports around the world that murder people for being gay\n\nWhat the actual fuck now, did we already forget that Obama and Hillary were the biggest pals of middle eastern oil sheiks? Hillary got half her campaign funding from Saudi Arabia - Trump went there and told them directly to cut out the terrorist bullshit. Also, Trump instated the travel ban for the six muslim countries, isn't it more than a little bit disingenuous to call him a muslim supporter after calling him an islamophobe for months?

The military refuses to hire tons of people for different reasons which is not discrimination, since serving in the military is <em>not a right</em>. People with lots of different mental disorders are turned away, for example people with severe depression, but saying that it&#39;s &quot;anti-depression discrimination&quot; would be silly. It&#39;s freakin&#39; common sense that people who present a higher risk than others are not allowed to serve. Trans people are in this category, it is a known fact that they are prone to suicide and depression, they are a risk to their peers in the military. If you think Trump just cooked up this idea because he hates trans people you&#39;re just being malicious.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>you believe that it should be okay to fire gay people for being gay</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think anyone should be fired for this specific reason but as far as I know what has been going on for decades now is that many employers hired LGBT people fulfilling quotas and cis-hetero people got fired for it. (The first example that comes to mind is the BBC and I know that&#39;s in the UK, but it happened in the US as well.) People who didn&#39;t raise their voice then should keep their mouths shut now, if what you say is true at all.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>and you support the same dictatorships that Trump supports around the world that murder people for being gay</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What the actual fuck now, did we already forget that Obama and Hillary were the biggest pals of middle eastern oil sheiks? Hillary got half her campaign funding from Saudi Arabia - Trump went there and told them directly to cut out the terrorist bullshit. Also, Trump instated the travel ban for the six muslim countries, isn&#39;t it more than a little bit disingenuous to call him a muslim supporter after calling him an islamophobe for months? He addressed the LGBT community saying he will protect them from islamic terrorism, which he&#39;s actively working on, for God&#39;s sake.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": ">Even when I was religious, I didn't understand the intense opposition to gay marriage that so many Christians have. There are dozens, maybe hundreds of different commands and moral \"goods\" and \"bads\" in the Bible. Homosexuality is mentioned something like two or three times in it. It is, at best, an absolutely incidental belief. Shaving and eating shellfish are also mentioned in the Bible as sins, but almost all Christians have done away with that.\n\nThe reason eating shellfish and shaving are not considered to be bad by Christians are because of Acts 15, where the Apostles went through and changed the church's stance on the immorality of those beliefs, but kept things such as \"sexual perversions, the torture of animals\" and obvious ones like the 10 Commandments.\n\nhttps://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+15&version=NIV\n\nNot eating shellfish, intercropping, etc. aren't selectively chosen to be wrong because of their irrelevance, but because there are parts of the New Testament saying that they are no longer wrong. This is why Jews still keep to many of the old traditions, as they don't follow the New Testament changing older things. It's also important to note, that depending on the translation, homosexuality may be referred to as \"an abomination\" and carry a sentence of *death*. It is not incidental, but a very strongly held belief at the time it was written, and still very widely held by many who hold the words of the bible very highly today. Eating shellfish, even at the time, did not carry such a punishment.\n\nOpposition to gay marriage is very much a religious thing, and religion is cited as one of the biggest reasons people are against gay marriage.\n\nReligion may be contradictory to the actual book, and people may twist and turn (or forget or invent) the words of the book, but the reasons for their motivation will be partially religion.

While many things are dismissed or ignored, it's unfair to say that *there is absolutely no justification* for it in the bible, where it blatantly says it is an abomination punishable by death.

At the very least, your view should be changed to \"The active opposition to gay marriage in America is *irrational* or *illogical* to be held as a strong religious belief, as the actions are hypocritical towards other passages\"",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Even when I was religious, I didn&#39;t understand the intense opposition to gay marriage that so many Christians have. There are dozens, maybe hundreds of different commands and moral &quot;goods&quot; and &quot;bads&quot; in the Bible. Homosexuality is mentioned something like two or three times in it. It is, at best, an absolutely incidental belief. Shaving and eating shellfish are also mentioned in the Bible as sins, but almost all Christians have done away with that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason eating shellfish and shaving are not considered to be bad by Christians are because of Acts 15, where the Apostles went through and changed the church&#39;s stance on the immorality of those beliefs, but kept things such as &quot;sexual perversions, the torture of animals&quot; and obvious ones like the 10 Commandments.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+15&amp;version=NIV\">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+15&amp;version=NIV</a></p>\n\n<p>Not eating shellfish, intercropping, etc. aren&#39;t selectively chosen to be wrong because of their irrelevance, but because there are parts of the New Testament saying that they are no longer wrong. This is why Jews still keep to many of the old traditions, as they don&#39;t follow the New Testament changing older things. It&#39;s also important to note, that depending on the translation, homosexuality may be referred to as &quot;an abomination&quot; and carry a sentence of <em>death</em>. It is not incidental, but a very strongly held belief at the time it was written, and still very widely held by many who hold the words of the bible very highly today. Eating shellfish, even at the time, did not carry such a punishment.</p>\n\n<p>Opposition to gay marriage is very much a religious thing, and religion is cited as one of the biggest reasons people are against gay marriage.</p>\n\n<p>Religion may be contradictory to the actual book, and people may twist and turn (or forget or invent) the words of the book, but the reasons for their motivation will be partially religion. To say that it is entirely because of their religion would be the fallacy of the single cause: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_the_single_cause\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_the_single_cause</a></p>\n\n<p>But, to say that it isn&#39;t because of religion <em>at all</em>, is also under that fallacy.

You don&#39;t want to rush things with someone you really like,  for one,  and you don&#39;t want to potentially cheapen the process of getting to know the guy with the false intimacy that sex can create.  Also you want to demonstrate that you have good judgement and don&#39;t fall into bed or in love with whoever takes you out for a beer or whatever.  </p>\n</div>",

            "body": "That's not what \"Patriarchy\" means or what feminism is about. You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding about what feminism is. It's not about blaming men, it's about blaming society. Here's something my wife wrote that explains what the \"patriarchy\" is about:\n\nThe patriarchy is a system that is propagated and enforced by men and women both. A system which rewards women for staying at home/childcare and punishes men for the same thing and vice versa, among many other things, regardless of anyone's actual wishes. But it has more to do with our culture, and prejudices we are raised with, that are incredibly difficult to ignore because they're everywhere. For example my husband's mom has said more incredibly sexist things to me than any man that I know. The idea of a patriarchy has nothing to do with 'blaming' men, or blaming anyone for that matter, and more to do with making an effort, over time, to improve quality of life for everyone in those areas. To be aware of gender biases and work to declaw or ignore them.\n\nThere's no doubt that patriarchy hurts men too. For instance, automatically awarding custody to a mother and almost never to the father. That bias comes from the idea that all women are natural caregivers and all men suck at it. All of the bullshit that tries to pigeonhole women into doing certain, feminine approved things with their lives also pigeonholes men to do opposite, manly approved things. But in fact, our interests and talents aren't restricted to our gender and gender actually has little or nothing to do with what we want to do with our lives. Despite that, the manly/feminine approved biases continue to run everything from our laws to our opportunities, and is a system of encouragement/discouragement that we get basically from birth from everyone from our parents to our teachers to our bosses. It's not about blaming anyone. It's about learning to see people as people and not as just a gender. Obviously this is just one of the facets of the issue but my point is that women and men both are responsible for propagating those biases and holding up the system.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>That&#39;s not what &quot;Patriarchy&quot; means or what feminism is about. You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding about what feminism is. It&#39;s not about blaming men, it&#39;s about blaming society. Here&#39;s something my wife wrote that explains what the &quot;patriarchy&quot; is about:</p>\n\n<p>The patriarchy is a system that is propagated and enforced by men and women both. A system which rewards women for staying at home/childcare and punishes men for the same thing and vice versa, among many other things, regardless of anyone&#39;s actual wishes. But it has more to do with our culture, and prejudices we are raised with, that are incredibly difficult to ignore because they&#39;re everywhere. For example my husband&#39;s mom has said more incredibly sexist things to me than any man that I know. The idea of a patriarchy has nothing to do with &#39;blaming&#39; men, or blaming anyone for that matter, and more to do with making an effort, over time, to improve quality of life for everyone in those areas. To be aware of gender biases and work to declaw or ignore them.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s no doubt that patriarchy hurts men too. For instance, automatically awarding custody to a mother and almost never to the father. That bias comes from the idea that all women are natural caregivers and all men suck at it. All of the bullshit that tries to pigeonhole women into doing certain, feminine approved things with their lives also pigeonholes men to do opposite, manly approved things. But in fact, our interests and talents aren&#39;t restricted to our gender and gender actually has little or nothing to do with what we want to do with our lives.

I don't think the evidence of masks and costumes is evidence of the antifa per se, as I'll believe this will be a common protesting tactic moving forward due to the growth and increased use of facial recognition. \n\nIn the videos you posted, I saw nothing unique or different from any other protest I've attended. Maybe I missed it, but there seemed to be nothing that indicated antifa presence. No visible signs or audible cues.

Firstly, the ban on beef is not anti-Muslim, it is about religious sentiment.

The government does support those initiatives as well.\n\nAnd I said blinkers on, because you ignore laws in Germany and France that ban burkinis - and this is not a pro-Christian law but specifically an Islamophobic law as they feel it is \"destroying their way of life\". You ignore laws in multiple American states that ban abortion or make it extremely difficult. And this is purely a law driven by strong religious beliefs.\n\nOh, and by the way, India always had a ban on beef, if you care to dig deeper. The government just decided to enforce/enact it more vigorously. Please explain how anti-abortion laws are \"better\" than beef ban laws, or laws that prevent minority women from dressing the way they want to. And please stop with the finding excuses - you quickly jump to valid reasons and excuses for banning burkhas and burkinis which actually directly infringe on people's basic rights of how they should dress themselves.

There is close to 2 orders of magnitude difference in population. France and Germany may not have that many attacks that lead to death but they have tons of routine and periodic hate crime and xenophobic attacks.\n\nhttp://hatecrime.osce.org/what-hate-crime/racism-and-xenophobia\n\nThere are multiple neo-nazi and far-right and anti-immigrants groups that routinely commit acts of violence and arson on immigrants and Muslims.\n\nOh, and does your definition of \"white Western countries\" also include countries in Eastern Europe?

And this is purely a law driven by strong religious beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and by the way, India always had a ban on beef, if you care to dig deeper.

And please stop with the finding excuses - you quickly jump to valid reasons and excuses for banning burkhas and burkinis which actually directly infringe on people&#39;s basic rights of how they should dress themselves.

                "body": "First, it's important to say that your argument is that \"in general, Republicans are hypocrites\", which implies to me that a majority of Republicans are hypocrites. So that's about half of the [23-40% of \"Republicans\"](http://www.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx). That's probably at least 40,000,000 people. That's a weighty accusation, and you'd probably have had a more defensible position if you argued that some Republican views were hypocritical, because then you might actually have a bunch of Republicans agreeing.\n\nSecond, Republicans are a party. Since we have two parties that capture the majority of votes in the country, their platforms will, by necessity, be structured in such a way as to try to rope in a lot of people. Republicans now have at least three clear ideological factions to my eye, those being traditional Goldwater conservatives, tea-party conservatives, and socially conservative religious voters. Those factions don't even necessarily agree on everything (or anything). So, knowing that many Republicans don't even agree with their party's views -- they simply prefer it to the alternative because they highly value some small subset -- are you still comfortable asserting that so many people are, individually, hypocrites?\n\nThat said, to address the actual points:\n\nPoint #1: Republicans do lay a clam to being a party of small government. However, everything you've cited as examples of government intervention are questions for which Republicans are morally motivated. Let's imagine someone who believes that law and order and protecting the innocent are proper functions of the government; and that intervening economically to help people who can't help themselves is a function better left to charity. This mindset can easily result in a consistent philosophy that wants the government to intervene when there are victims - whether that is the people who suffer from drug trade, the unborn child/fetus of the woman who wants an abortion, or the invalid who has a right to life even if his spouse wants to end life support. I'm not making an argument that any of these things are immoral. (I even used two terms in the abortion because even the terminology of abortion is completely loaded.)\n\nThe reality is, we all have a set of moral beliefs, and we all, in general, believe that the government should legislate morality. Sometimes these beliefs are extremely contentious - such as abortion. Other times, there are times when society as a whole has no problem overriding someone's individual choices (for example, we'd generally not be shy about overriding a parent's choice to withhold antibiotics from a sick child, because they believed healing not based on faith was an affront to God).\n\nKeeping in mind that many Republicans in the faction of the religiously motivated voters don't even particularly **care** about economic policy, realize that when they push for candidates to oppose gay marriage, they are doing it strictly out of a sense that it is a sinful act and inherently immoral, and on that grounds, they feel it is not only acceptable but **necessary** for the government to protect society. I don't at all agree, but it doesn't make them hypocrites. Meanwhile, they quite likely care very little for economic policy - or, at most, they have a vague feeling that the government is large and wasteful, but don't particularly care about the details because they're voting their morality on social issues regardless.\n\nWhat I'd say is that you are seeing their platform views through your own lens. Truth be told, I've used that exact same argument before, because I think it **is** persuasive to the non-religious Republican. (I also think the fractured factions of the Republicans are responsible for their being unable to play their role in government effectively, and will ultimately lead to a decline in the party or some sort of platform \"purge\" that will marginalize at least one of the competing factions.)\n\nPoint #2: (Some) Republicans believe that higher taxes stifle growth, especially on people who have money to invest. This is [supply-side economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_side_economics) 101. Almost everyone on both sides of the aisle believes in the reality of the [Laffer Curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve), which posits that there is an optimal tax rate for revenue generation: you can raise taxes up to an optimal point, at which point the taxation becomes too much friction for economic growth and personal motivation, and additional taxes lead to reduced revenues. There's a [blog here](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/reagan-showed-it-can-be-done-lower-top-rate-28-percent-and-raise-more-revenue) on tax rates on capital gains. I don't actually interpret the results the way that they do, because you'll see that after spikes in revenue, capital gains revenue returns to normal.\n\nWhat basically every economist agrees on is that people respond to incentives. As you can see from the chart, capital gains going up produced a huge spike in revenue also, because people re-allocated capital while they could at a lower rate. Lowering it also raised revenue because people re-allocated it after it was freed up. I think many economists would like some sort of middle ground where capital that was re-allocated from investment to investment was tax free, and capital gains liquidated and spent on consumption were taxed as ordinary income.\n\nThat said, this explains why they believe that sometimes, cutting taxes can raise revenue. They believe this is stronger on the richer folks, because they invest and investment creates economic growth. The people on the left tend to believe more in demand-side economics; effectively that when people have money to spend, they spend it, and businesses will respond to that opportunity and invest.\n\nThis is actually very muddy water. For example, [Greg Mankiw](http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/) a very prominent economist and former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors under Bush, is a prominent Keynesian, and wrote:\n\n> \"If you were going to turn to only one economist to understand the problems facing the economy, there is little doubt that the economist would be John Maynard Keynes. Although Keynes died more than a half-century ago, his diagnosis of recessions and depressions remains the foundation of modern macroeconomics. His insights go a long way toward explaining the challenges we now confront.\"\n\nAnd yet, Mankiw was not convinced that the 2008-2009 stimulus was a good idea, whereas other prominent Keynesians like Paul Krugman actually warned that it was the right idea but smaller than it should have been.\n\nAnd Richard Posner, who is a famous jurist and also a prominent academic economist, [rather famously changed his views to be more Keynesian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Failure_of_Capitalism) in his book \"A Failure of Capitalism\".\n\nBoth sides have a moral component to their view, as well. The leftist view often draws upon the idea of the [Veil of Ignorance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance) and suggests that the rich earn their fortunes through a mix of luck, circumstances, and genetics. The right would suggest that economic freedom is critical and that man has a right to the fruits of his own labor, and anything less is tantamount to \"slavery\". (I'm quoting that word because I've read it used in that context many times but can't say it with a straight face without the quotes.)  The right often borrows from the Ayn Rand viewpoint:\n\n> My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\n\nThey might argue that the most poor, destitute souls of our society have a lot that is far better than they did a hundred or two hundred years ago, and it is the achievements of great people who have led to that. This might manifest in a desire for policy as close to a flat tax as possible, for example, believing that while we must fund things, we should all contribute equal to our production.\n\nAs far as military spending goes, it is sometimes a tenet on the right that civil and national defense is the primary purpose of government: police and the military effectively being the tool of the government to maintain law and order, and the rest should be left in private hands. So their refusal to cut military spending is consistent with that. There's an obvious counterargument that we spend primarily on proactive \"offense\" than on defense, since we have no real threats directly to our national interests. We do, however, often work to counter threats to our allies around the world, and so there is a counter-counter argument that such spending makes a better world. And of course, reality is muddy. Intervening to stop genocide is probably well and good, and I'm not a fan of a strictly nationalist policy. On the flip side, I absolutely agree with arguments made on both sides that our foreign policy and our use of military creates many enemies, however many threats it counters.\n\n[ Continued in reply.... ]",

(I even used two terms in the abortion because even the terminology of abortion is completely loaded.)</p>\n\n<p>The reality is, we all have a set of moral beliefs, and we all, in general, believe that the government should legislate morality. Sometimes these beliefs are extremely contentious - such as abortion. Other times, there are times when society as a whole has no problem overriding someone&#39;s individual choices (for example, we&#39;d generally not be shy about overriding a parent&#39;s choice to withhold antibiotics from a sick child, because they believed healing not based on faith was an affront to God).</p>\n\n<p>Keeping in mind that many Republicans in the faction of the religiously motivated voters don&#39;t even particularly <strong>care</strong> about economic policy, realize that when they push for candidates to oppose gay marriage, they are doing it strictly out of a sense that it is a sinful act and inherently immoral, and on that grounds, they feel it is not only acceptable but <strong>necessary</strong> for the government to protect society. I don&#39;t at all agree, but it doesn&#39;t make them hypocrites. Meanwhile, they quite likely care very little for economic policy - or, at most, they have a vague feeling that the government is large and wasteful, but don&#39;t particularly care about the details because they&#39;re voting their morality on social issues regardless.</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;d say is that you are seeing their platform views through your own lens. Truth be told, I&#39;ve used that exact same argument before, because I think it <strong>is</strong> persuasive to the non-religious Republican. (I also think the fractured factions of the Republicans are responsible for their being unable to play their role in government effectively, and will ultimately lead to a decline in the party or some sort of platform &quot;purge&quot; that will marginalize at least one of the competing factions.)</p>\n\n<p>Point #2: (Some) Republicans believe that higher taxes stifle growth, especially on people who have money to invest. This is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_side_economics\">supply-side economics</a> 101. Almost everyone on both sides of the aisle believes in the reality of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve\">Laffer Curve</a>, which posits that there is an optimal tax rate for revenue generation: you can raise taxes up to an optimal point, at which point the taxation becomes too much friction for economic growth and personal motivation, and additional taxes lead to reduced revenues. There&#39;s a <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/blog/reagan-showed-it-can-be-done-lower-top-rate-28-percent-and-raise-more-revenue\">blog here</a> on tax rates on capital gains. I don&#39;t actually interpret the results the way that they do, because you&#39;ll see that after spikes in revenue, capital gains revenue returns to normal.</p>\n\n<p>What basically every economist agrees on is that people respond to incentives. As you can see from the chart, capital gains going up produced a huge spike in revenue also, because people re-allocated capital while they could at a lower rate. Lowering it also raised revenue because people re-allocated it after it was freed up. I think many economists would like some sort of middle ground where capital that was re-allocated from investment to investment was tax free, and capital gains liquidated and spent on consumption were taxed as ordinary income.</p>\n\n<p>That said, this explains why they believe that sometimes, cutting taxes can raise revenue. They believe this is stronger on the richer folks, because they invest and investment creates economic growth. The people on the left tend to believe more in demand-side economics; effectively that when people have money to spend, they spend it, and businesses will respond to that opportunity and invest.</p>\n\n<p>This is actually very muddy water. For example, <a href=\"http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/\">Greg Mankiw</a> a very prominent economist and former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors under Bush, is a prominent Keynesian, and wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;If you were going to turn to only one economist to understand the problems facing the economy, there is little doubt that the economist would be John Maynard Keynes. Although Keynes died more than a half-century ago, his diagnosis of recessions and depressions remains the foundation of modern macroeconomics. His insights go a long way toward explaining the challenges we now confront.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And yet, Mankiw was not convinced that the 2008-2009 stimulus was a good idea, whereas other prominent Keynesians like Paul Krugman actually warned that it was the right idea but smaller than it should have been.</p>\n\n<p>And Richard Posner, who is a famous jurist and also a prominent academic economist, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Failure_of_Capitalism\">rather famously changed his views to be more Keynesian</a> in his book &quot;A Failure of Capitalism&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Both sides have a moral component to their view, as well. The leftist view often draws upon the idea of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance\">Veil of Ignorance</a> and suggests that the rich earn their fortunes through a mix of luck, circumstances, and genetics. The right would suggest that economic freedom is critical and that man has a right to the fruits of his own labor, and anything less is tantamount to &quot;slavery&quot;. (I&#39;m quoting that word because I&#39;ve read it used in that context many times but can&#39;t say it with a straight face without the quotes.)  The right often borrows from the Ayn Rand viewpoint:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They might argue that the most poor, destitute souls of our society have a lot that is far better than they did a hundred or two hundred years ago, and it is the achievements of great people who have led to that. This might manifest in a desire for policy as close to a flat tax as possible, for example, believing that while we must fund things, we should all contribute equal to our production.</p>\n\n<p>As far as military spending goes, it is sometimes a tenet on the right that civil and national defense is the primary purpose of government: police and the military effectively being the tool of the government to maintain law and order, and the rest should be left in private hands. So their refusal to cut military spending is consistent with that. There&#39;s an obvious counterargument that we spend primarily on proactive &quot;offense&quot; than on defense, since we have no real threats directly to our national interests. We do, however, often work to counter threats to our allies around the world, and so there is a counter-counter argument that such spending makes a better world. And of course, reality is muddy. Intervening to stop genocide is probably well and good, and I&#39;m not a fan of a strictly nationalist policy. On the flip side, I absolutely agree with arguments made on both sides that our foreign policy and our use of military creates many enemies, however many threats it counters.</p>\n\n<p>[ Continued in reply.... ]</p>\n</div>",

That said, there is a possibility here that avoids hypocrisy altogether: you can only fight so many battles. The moralists are pouring their time, energy, and money into fighting against abortion and gay marriage. If they can win those fights, they might pursue other policies that align the government closer to a judeo-christian theocracy, but in the team time, they have their hands full. It's easy to find actual individual hypocrites, of course: preachers and conservative politicians caught in scandals involving prostitutes and bathroom stalls are almost laughably common. The rank and file, however, would likely argue that they're not discriminating at all: they just want to uphold moral behavior in society.\n\nPoint #4: Your argument is a bit vague here, and this is probably because \"states' rights\" is so vague. There's some Constitutional history here - the word \"expressly\" was intentionally left out of the 10th Amendment, which reads;\n\n>  The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\nHad it said \"expressly delegated\", the jurisprudence of the last 200+ years may have been wildly different. Instead, it rubs roughly against the \"Necessary and Proper Clause\" of Article I of the Constitution, which reads:\n\n> The Congress shall have Power ... To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\n\nAs such, I think it's dangerous to suggest hypocrisy where the states-rights issues are concerned. Granted, there is inconsistency at times, but those are **very** muddy waters, and hypocrisy is a higher charge than mere inconsistency. It is a deception; and yet states-rights issues are already almost purely the stuff of rhetoric, so finding some manner of sophistry which appears to legitimately support States' Rights in one case but not another isn't hard to do.\n\nPoint #5: This is actually the weakest argument, I'd say: if an unborn child is alive, at whatever stage (whether than is embryonic or moments before birth), then we are talking about protecting the life of an innocent human being. The flip side is that the death penalty is reserved for horrible crimes. One could argue that it is exactly that life is so precious that makes execution of murderers justified; they've committed the ultimate crime. This isn't hypocrisy; it isn't even inconsistent, it is just a wordplay on \"every life is precious\", because the people saying that in the abortion context certainly were not suggesting that the lives of murderers were too precious to take them as punishment.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm not a death penalty supporter because statistically, it costs more to execute someone than imprison them for life, and it is clear that innocent people have, and will continue to be, executed. I'd rather lock up 20 guilty men and leave them alive than execute one innocent man -- and that's even assuming I'd want to execute the guilty man even if the cost was small and there was no chance of error. Fortunately, it's a moot point since that isn't the case on either point.\n\nIn conclusion: the Republicans are a group of people you disagree with politically. Some few are demagogues, but they are certainly not \"in general\" hypocrites. This is especially true when you take into account the factions that exist in the republican party, which means that not everyone agrees with all the planks of their typical platform, meaning many Republicans will emphatically desire some plank while being barely tolerant of another, and this is largely the byproduct of a two-party system than any inherent cohesion in their viewpoints.",

Wasting money on an ineffective program is not necessarily good for society, because those resources could be spent more effectively either in other government programs or by people themselves. So dismantling a bad program in itself is an alternative because it frees up resources to be spent elsewhere. Notice how you did NOTHING to backup your infantile, vapid, talking point nonsense and instead just doubled down on it? \n\nHere's a Frederic Bastiat quote that you may find interesting (though more likely you won't understand it or internalize how it applies to you):\n\n>\u201cSocialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.\u201d \n\nConservatives think the best way to help people is capitalism and the free market, not inefficient government programs. If you acknowledge that government programs aren't **literally the only way to help people** then you'll see that these simplistic accusations you're making are absurd.\n\n>Except that, as I've shown in detail and you've struggled to refute, neither of these labels is accurate.\n\nI haven't struggled at all. In the context of an abortion, the pro-life position results in more life, the pro-choice position results in more death.",

You&#39;d rather see it suffer than help it to thrive. Shame on you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Actually I&#39;m all about the well-being of all humans, that includes the unborn ones. Wasting money on an ineffective program is not necessarily good for society, because those resources could be spent more effectively either in other government programs or by people themselves. So dismantling a bad program in itself is an alternative because it frees up resources to be spent elsewhere. Notice how you did NOTHING to backup your infantile, vapid, talking point nonsense and instead just doubled down on it? </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a Frederic Bastiat quote that you may find interesting (though more likely you won&#39;t understand it or internalize how it applies to you):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cSocialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.\u201d </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Conservatives think the best way to help people is capitalism and the free market, not inefficient government programs. If you acknowledge that government programs aren&#39;t <strong>literally the only way to help people</strong> then you&#39;ll see that these simplistic accusations you&#39;re making are absurd.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Except that, as I&#39;ve shown in detail and you&#39;ve struggled to refute, neither of these labels is accurate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t struggled at all. In the context of an abortion, the pro-life position results in more life, the pro-choice position results in more death.</p>\n</div>",

It&#39;s obviously the latter; you have no apparent awareness of the variation of opinion among conservatives and can&#39;t differentiate between the things Donald Trump says and the things most of the right believes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The antifa has no agenda though. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is objectively wrong.  They are openly anarcho-communist (they aren&#39;t really sure about that), thus all the hammer $ sickle and random fisty flags at their demonstrations.  And if they believe the country is in the control of fascists, they&#39;re stupid.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is a common argument I&#39;ve seen: that because some liberals use words like racist and fascist, they become meaningless. I think it supports my point that liberals would be better off by discussing politics with Trump supporters less. Then they might realise where they&#39;ve gone wrong themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or maybe they could keep talking politics but stop calling everything that doesn&#39;t explicitly benefit minorities racist, stop calling everything that isn&#39;t socialist fascist, and then we&#39;ll be able to use those words when someone is actually being a bigot instead of as a weapon to attack people who have different views.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll end with this: you should keep this view as it pertains to you.  You don&#39;t seem genuinely interested in understanding a Trump supporter&#39;s point of view, and I don&#39;t think you can charitably assess American conservatism in its context.  It would be best if you didn&#39;t talk to Trump supporters because all you&#39;ll do is make things worse by antagonizing them on behalf of liberals and centrists like myself.</p>\n</div>",

Lol. \n\n>as if becoming a politician automatically negates any personal preferences or biases the person might have\n\nYou have no clue how politics really work. Politicians don't impose their will on their voters. They *cater* to it. As such, personal bias may exist, but only to the detriment of their political success. \n\nWhen you're selling a product, you need it to be something your customers want, not something you want. Same with politics: if you want to win elections, you have to do what the electorate wants, or at least convince them that you would if you were elected. \n\n>and no politician ever does anything that the voters didn't want.\n\nPoliticians often go against the voters - namely when strong lobbies get involved. So thanks for reminding yourself of that.\n\n\n>its main problem is just that when women buy a product, they have immediate feedback as to whether it's something they like or not, and have many other choices competing for their money. Products promise outcomes based on commercials, and then the women either attain the result promised or they don't and they stop buying it.

But other times very much by their fault, even if unconsciously, and often times in ways that do not translate to immediate knowledge by the people who voted for them.\n\n\nNothing forces voters to re-elect a candidate who has failed to live up to their promises. I get as upset as anyone else that politicians don't get nearly enough punishment for that. But, like I said elsewhere, I have not problem with the claim that the electorate is largely stupid. \n\nThe fact that the feedback isn't as immediate and not in real-time the way most products are, doesn't invalidate the analogy at all. Some products are far less immediate than voting. Car manufactures are similarly bound to catering to their customers as any other business. The reaction is delayed but not nullified by that delay. \n\n>And on top of all that, there are very limited choices for political representatives in each district.\n\nThat does skew things but it doesn't turn them upside down. As long as there's more than one candidate at any election, there is competition for voters. And winning the female vote is more profitable than winning the male vote. \n\n\n>Even in the incredibly unlikely case that 51% of the voters specifically want to vote for representatives that favor women's interests at the expense of men's, they may disagree with other issues that take precedent or also influence votes toward different candidates that no longer have to worry about doing more than paying lip service to such interests, as the only politicians in the district who stand opposed to them have no assurance of drawing in the lost votes anyway.\n\nFinally an interesting point. Omg, that took ages. It's irrelevant of course because it applies equally to both sexes, sorry to disappoint you there, but it's still a useful observation. Because it illustrates that *how many* voters support something isn't the only variable. How much they care, is another. That's how it happens that politicians go against the majority but don't get punished for it because that majority didn't mind sufficiently. The issue just wasn't important enough to them. But guess who decides how much the electorate care about an issue? Yup. The electorate. Not the politicians. \n\n\n> Treating representative as pure personifications of the voter's will does not reflect reality\n\nThey are pretty much that (barring lobby influence of course). They're puppets. Nothing more. Actors. They play roles that are popular in the public. It's a dreadful job if you ask me. \nIt's amazing how many people are fooled into thinking the politicians are some kind of authority figures like in a monarchy. I suppose it's convenient to have someone to blame. The harsh reality that the general public just makes stupid choices because most people are cretins that love to believe in myths over the truth, is a hard pill to swallow. \n\nYou seem to share that aversion to the truth. You are determined to believe your ideology. I could tell you to imagine a puppy being fried in a microwave and then imagine a snail being fried in a microwave and notice the difference in horror and empathy you feel between the two. That very difference is caused by the same thing that causes you to feel differently about a man with a bloody face and a woman with a bloody face. And that same difference is why you gravitate towards feminism and anything with the word \"femin\" in it. And no matter how obvious it's held in your face, you'd find some way to explain it away or claim you're not like that and it's just everybody else or the patriarchy did it. I don't even mind if you're biased but I do mind if you try to sell it to me as though you're being unbiased. ",

And winning the female vote is more profitable than winning the male vote. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even in the incredibly unlikely case that 51% of the voters specifically want to vote for representatives that favor women&#39;s interests at the expense of men&#39;s, they may disagree with other issues that take precedent or also influence votes toward different candidates that no longer have to worry about doing more than paying lip service to such interests, as the only politicians in the district who stand opposed to them have no assurance of drawing in the lost votes anyway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally an interesting point. Omg, that took ages. It&#39;s irrelevant of course because it applies equally to both sexes, sorry to disappoint you there, but it&#39;s still a useful observation. Because it illustrates that <em>how many</em> voters support something isn&#39;t the only variable. How much they care, is another. That&#39;s how it happens that politicians go against the majority but don&#39;t get punished for it because that majority didn&#39;t mind sufficiently. The issue just wasn&#39;t important enough to them. But guess who decides how much the electorate care about an issue? Yup. The electorate. Not the politicians. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Treating representative as pure personifications of the voter&#39;s will does not reflect reality</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They are pretty much that (barring lobby influence of course). They&#39;re puppets. Nothing more. Actors. They play roles that are popular in the public. It&#39;s a dreadful job if you ask me. \nIt&#39;s amazing how many people are fooled into thinking the politicians are some kind of authority figures like in a monarchy. I suppose it&#39;s convenient to have someone to blame. The harsh reality that the general public just makes stupid choices because most people are cretins that love to believe in myths over the truth, is a hard pill to swallow. </p>\n\n<p>You seem to share that aversion to the truth. You are determined to believe your ideology. I could tell you to imagine a puppy being fried in a microwave and then imagine a snail being fried in a microwave and notice the difference in horror and empathy you feel between the two. That very difference is caused by the same thing that causes you to feel differently about a man with a bloody face and a woman with a bloody face. And that same difference is why you gravitate towards feminism and anything with the word &quot;femin&quot; in it. And no matter how obvious it&#39;s held in your face, you&#39;d find some way to explain it away or claim you&#39;re not like that and it&#39;s just everybody else or the patriarchy did it. I don&#39;t even mind if you&#39;re biased but I do mind if you try to sell it to me as though you&#39;re being unbiased. </p>\n</div>",

Why can we apply moral questions to economic distributions but not romantic distributions?\n\nI may be derailing, but I'm pretty sure this is part of the fundament to your opinions.\n\n(Reasonable) moral systems regarding economic distributions seek to settle what you deserve freedom from and freedom to, with regards to desires (products/services) and fears (from unfairness/differences caused by factors beyond personal influence). They seek to give everyone equal opportunity, and everybody disagrees with one system or another. But in a society where every single individual fully subscribes to one system or the other, no member should ever find reasons to complain or stray away from the system.\n\nIn an ideal libertarian society, nobody should complain about any amount of goods and services they get to enjoy. Everybody agrees that they deserve what they work for, and you are not actively holding things back from anybody or taking anything from them. Likewise, in a ideal socialist (or communist) society, everybody shares resources and basically live like a huge family, money may not even be necessary, people just agree on what to do and share all the time. Nobody complains. Nothing is done to harm anyone's desires, or take anything from anybody.\n\nMorals regarding romantic \"distribution\" would be forced to deal with a very significant problem: satisfying  supporters of this hypothetical moral system **in any way at all**, is not guaranteed if they all lived in their own society; sure, you can learn to love someone, but relationships demand consent from both sides; economics do not deal with mutual consent in living together and treating each other like human beings. \n\nAnother major difference is that romance is by default absent, unlike poverty; everyone is born into the exact same state of romance being absent (though not love, which is a much broader term), but chances of varying success. With regards to economic well-being, one can be born into that success, with chances of achieving even more still, but that is not the case with romance. Romance cannot be treated like economics. The product produced is memories, a lifetime of fun and games, a value beyond what an economy can ever produce and radically different by nature; like comparing apples and oranges, but some still prefer one over the other. Many would willingly choose mediocre housing and an everlasting romance with the perfect fit, all in the journey towards a happy life.\n\nTrying to distribute romantic relationships (in order to distribute the benefits of it), through some kind of karma, is unique in how inevitable it is, that someone will have something done **against his/her will**, to him/herself. Even supporters of this moral system, because desires for a partner need not be in alignment with this moral system; we cannot control who we want. Your emotions will never respond well if I point at someone I say will be your partner, when you already know of someone you want. **This moral system will lead to forced marriage, so to speak.** Or alternatively, if you don't want your deserved partner, you get no one. If you don't want the best possible partner that you deserve, you're shit out of luck and have no reason to believe in this moral system anymore.\n\nMoral economic systems only do things *for* people, not against anyone, as long as they stay within their principles. Socialism, by its own principles, does only things to benefit people, not to hurt anyone. Libertarianism also does, while abiding by its principles.\n\nWhatever morals you try to apply to romantic affairs, it is inevitable that some person X will desire person Y, but person Y does not desire person X. This will happen even if both believe in some sort of metric of what they deserve - the problem here is that what they deserve and desire may be completely in conflict, and the moral system does not make any attempts to resolve that. Instead it enforces forced marriage between individuals who do not want each other, and this feeling may result on loathing and overall a bad marriage, and unless you permit divorce, you are not doing anybody any favours. \n\nIf the moral system disregards both individuals' desires, you are going to hurting some people by design of the system, thus the moral system fails at its purposes and there is no reason to keep it.\n\nIf you disregard the desires of only one person, you will inevitably hurt the other; person X might deserve Y but X might not like Y. Again, the moral system fails.\n\nIf you do not disregard either person's desires, then you must respect the fact that it is inevitable that two persons who might deserve each other, want something more. \n\nThe moral system is met with failures even within its own supporter base no matter what. The economic morals have no such failures to acknowledge, because they are in alignment with the principles that underpin them.\n\n____________\n\nHere's one of your opinions flipped around and into a question: is it (in)appropriate to be rewarded for having a good personality? Is it perhaps a reward in and by itself?\n\n>I think that personality is innate or at least unchanging after childhood so if you are fucked up by a traumatic childhood experience there is no hope for you.\n\n>[...] I think that it is equally unjust for someone to have trouble finding an SO because they have a bad personality.\n\nYou really have to make a claim on what is just, in that case.\n\nAnother thought-experiment: we now have two persons whose physical body is completely identical, but one has way worse personality - let's say it's a thoroughly destructive person who revels in the destruction of others' lives. Let's say it's basically a seriously evil twin hellbent on world domination/destruction, and a good twin. Is there any reason to favour the evil twin, barring reasons like masochism and some strange fetish for wickedness?\n\n\nI'd choose the good twin for the following reasons: \n\nThroughout life, we are faced with many decisions, and even daily, there are many decisions that we do not think about for even a second. My experiences are many, ranging from emotional to intellectual. Good things have been done to me. Bad things were done to me. But an eye for an eye, and the whole world goes blind. I decided for myself to be better. Of course, we're all inspired/shaped by some external sources at some point, but the decision is ultimately up to each individual. Nature and nurture both play a role. Your decisions define you as a human. (And your worth/what you deserve, in any sense. Needless to say, Osama bin Laden and his lot would never be considered equal in worth compared to an average human.)\n\nI will condemn the evil twin and preferably never allow this demon a relationship, for the following:\n\nI could have been selfish and justified my actions because of fickle reasons like \"the world was unfair to me, so I will be unfair to the world\". But that is ignorant and foolish. **It is irresponsible and immoral that my wickedness should hurt those who had no say in forming me**, and especially those who had nothing to do with any of it. Even worse, this would be like allowing someone else's evil deeds to trickle through and corrupt me, and potentially others, leaving a vicious spiral. Those who succumb to evil, are not good people, and it is better for everyone that they be enlightened rather than cause further harm of any kind.\n\nA bad personality need not be shaped by bad decisions alone, but I believe that mankind always has the choice to be better, given anything that might change one's mind. People's choices later in life is not some sort of awakening of hidden tendencies. Experiences with other people shape us constantly. Good experiences inspire us, evil deeds challenge us. To throw away responsibility of how you are as a sentient, intelligent being, is just childish.",

Give the bully what he wants, and maybe tomorrow he won&#39;t want your lunch money. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Give the bully what he wants? Like not being isolated to an open air prison and apartheid that is under blockade? Or perhaps it&#39;s food and medical supplies that are simply unreasonable? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That is my criticism. Israel is killing far more people than its had killed and far more indiscriminately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just think about how many people would be killed if Hamas didn&#39;t fire rockets at Israel. Now think about how many German and Japanese civilians were killed in WWII vs. American and British civilians. Maybe you&#39;ll realize that morality by numbers is no morality at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And yet, here we are, Israel is killing something like 40-50x as many Palestinians with a good number being women and children. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I never said it was illegal. I said it was wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apparently the framers of international law disagreed with you, because they made it legal. But I&#39;m sure you know best. Personally, I think using human shields is both wrong and illegal. Do you disagree?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You just said it was legal.

Do you need to blow up buildings, kill innocent people, think a certain way, and be apart of a radical or religious group?\n\nWell, yeah, you need to target non-strategic targets in a way to incite mayhem and fear to accomplish a political goal.  So, if you are just insane and think it's fun to kill people, you aren't a terrorist, just a murderer without a political agenda.

You clearly don't or you refuse to see the difference between correcting what is an undesirable behavior and what is in fact harassment. You lump the two together in your crusade to lend legitimacy to your argument by making it appear to be a larger problem than it is, but all you're doing is undermining the real social problems (like gay bashing and religious intolerance) by grouping them together with things that people should not simply except. If an antagonist is making fun of someone because they are gay or jewish, then that is a separate issue from making fun of someone for being overweight and should be treated as such. Nowadays we know what health concerns arise when you are overweight, we know that the most common cause these days is people eating junk. From the time kids can talk their parents teach them what is good for them to eat and what is unhealthy. The other kids can see that Suzy isn't healthy when she can't run with them in gym class, or when she gets winded walking up a flight of stairs. They see her in the lunchroom throwing down six snack cakes when they all know that they should not be eating that many in a day, much less one sitting. They make fun of her because that's the only way they know how to bring attention to the issue.

You clearly don&#39;t or you refuse to see the difference between correcting what is an undesirable behavior and what is in fact harassment. You lump the two together in your crusade to lend legitimacy to your argument by making it appear to be a larger problem than it is, but all you&#39;re doing is undermining the real social problems (like gay bashing and religious intolerance) by grouping them together with things that people should not simply except. If an antagonist is making fun of someone because they are gay or jewish, then that is a separate issue from making fun of someone for being overweight and should be treated as such. Nowadays we know what health concerns arise when you are overweight, we know that the most common cause these days is people eating junk. From the time kids can talk their parents teach them what is good for them to eat and what is unhealthy. The other kids can see that Suzy isn&#39;t healthy when she can&#39;t run with them in gym class, or when she gets winded walking up a flight of stairs. They see her in the lunchroom throwing down six snack cakes when they all know that they should not be eating that many in a day, much less one sitting. They make fun of her because that&#39;s the only way they know how to bring attention to the issue. They don&#39;t think that anyone else sees that Suzy has a problem because if they did, they would be trying to fix it. Some might do this to be mean, but those are by far not the norm. For you, who are in a <strong>teaching</strong> position, to say that making fun of someone who is hurting themselves is as bad as being a skinhead just re-enforces my opinion that this is a flawed premises that is being executed by people who do not have a realistic perspective.</p>\n</div>",

Some might do this to be mean, but those are by far not the norm.\n\nThis is a fantasy which springs from your romanticized view of what bullying is.  In reality, the groups that are bullying the most are the ones that have problems in their own social life that lead them to having self esteem issues.  They use bullying as a form of validation.  The control that they exert over their weaker peers helps them feel better, it is a form of control that they lack in their home life.

Teenagers who make fun of people for being gay are using that child's homosexuality in the same way they would use any other aspect of them.  Tom is gay, he's different, so they make fun of him.  Suzy is fat, she's different, so they make fun of her.  They're not bullying because they are neo-nazis, they are bullying to exert social control and feel better about themselves.\n\nYour notion that it is to illicit social change is backed up by nothing at all.  It may, in some outlying cases, result in behavorial change, but the vast majority of these cases result in negative consequences for the victim *regardless of the reasons they are bullied for*.  That is why there is a national campaign to stop bullying.  There have been dozens upon dozens upon dozens of studies done on this subject by experts 'round the USA.  \n\n>Bullying is not a means of \"correcting unacceptable behavior\", because it doesn't meet the requirements to illicit a change in behavior. If you use basic ABA philosophy and methods to look at the behavior of bullying itself, the bully is getting reinforcement from the action of bullying not the victim. Either this is through belittling the individual or the reaction he/she gets from the action he took to make fun of the victim in the first place. This totally doesn't fit into your assertion that it's meant to change undesirable behavior in others, because it doesn't lead to change. It leads to a continuation of the behavior by the bullying because he's reinforced for doing the bullying itself.\n\nThis is the important part of mombo's post, the part I was really hoping you'd read.  There are mountains upon mountains of evidence pointing to bullying as bad, and the only thing you have to say otherwise is \"Well, in my particular case it helped me\".

The concept of race certainly has it's trappings because it is popularly used to group people based on their looks. There are people that might or might not be white, depending on whoever you ask, which makes race a murky concept to say the least. \n\nIn general however I believe that if someone does not believe in race he can't be racist -- in theory.

This seems to result in very few actual incidents of racism. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is something that unfortunately can&#39;t be known unless there is a clear pattern or message of intent, i.e. a hate crime being committed with the perpetrator clearly stating that prejudice was the motivation. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is race is even a coherent concept? If it isn&#39;t then can someone be a racist if they don&#39;t believe in race? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a very interesting question! The concept of race certainly has it&#39;s trappings because it is popularly used to group people based on their looks. There are people that might or might not be white, depending on whoever you ask, which makes race a murky concept to say the least. </p>\n\n<p>In general however I believe that if someone does not believe in race he can&#39;t be racist -- in theory. In practice racism can exist subconsciously but in such a case it is obviously very difficult to prove.</p>\n\n<p>As for your last remark... well that&#39;s why I asked this question! I wanted to see if someone can convince me of a better &quot;model of racism&quot;, so to speak. </p>\n</div>",

Complaining about this happening in the US is, IMHO, silly. You're from CA as well and I think we can both agree there's not a lot of culture for Mexican immigrants to erase. What do we even have? Surfing? Nice climate? Smoking weed? And not one of those things are unique to californians. But when you look at Europeans who have hundreds if not thousands of years of rich, defined culture in their countries, I could see how people would be up in arms if they felt that was at risk. And they should be, just as much as if Middle Eastern or Asian or African culture was at risk of being marginalized in those places by white immigrants.

On the surface it doesn&#39;t seem such a bad thing, but in practice I think it often manifests into ugly forms of racism, hatred, and discrimination. For those reasons I don&#39;t particularly <em>want</em> Europeans to practice nationalism, especially white nationalism, but I also don&#39;t see any other practical recourse for them if they want to maintain a strong culture, which I feel they have a right to be interested in doing. Complaining about this happening in the US is, IMHO, silly. You&#39;re from CA as well and I think we can both agree there&#39;s not a lot of culture for Mexican immigrants to erase. What do we even have? Surfing? Nice climate? Smoking weed? And not one of those things are unique to californians. But when you look at Europeans who have hundreds if not thousands of years of rich, defined culture in their countries, I could see how people would be up in arms if they felt that was at risk. And they should be, just as much as if Middle Eastern or Asian or African culture was at risk of being marginalized in those places by white immigrants. I just don&#39;t see an easy solution in the current climate.</p>\n</div>",

Turns out he might have been right about repackaged Christianity, but he was wrong about global warming.\n\n\"No more hunger, no more poverty, no more death\" has always been the ultimate goal of moral people. It's not good evidence that they're blinded by primal voodoo belief because it can be explained very well by optimism regarding the technology.\n\nThey are similar because of the omnipotent being thing, but people (even in the field) aren't sure an artificial superintelligence is going to be friendly, even when they're fairly certain it will show up soon. So quite different from Christianity.\n\nAll in all, I'm perfectly willing to consider that even the smartest minds in the field are being very, very optimistic (in fact, that's what I believe).

The age most certainly would not be identical in every case, as there are very astute 8-year-olds and very stupid 18-year-olds.\n\nIf the discussion cannot happen yet, it is a lack of logical development in the child. Then it would make sense for the 'because I told you so' to be in place, since they can't operate as rational agents. \n\nI do agree with you in expecting for parents to keep their kids in line. However, I think some areas of behavior are more black and white than others. For example, if their child punches other kids for asking to share their toy, that is a problem. But if a child was constantly bullying another child, then the one on the receiving end decided to finally hit back, I think some parents could misconstrue that as 'misbehaving.'\n\nI think your police officer example is very helpful to my own reflection. But I think that the relationship between police officers and civilians isn't identical to parents and children. Of course the civilians need to listen to the police officer in that instance, but there are officers who take the law into their own hands, and I think that the civilian should not be penalized for speaking up if that is the case. \n\nI agree with you to a degree on the employee example. That relationship seems to be how things should work in the workplace. However, I don't think it can quite be applied to parenting. The employee is being paid for this deference to the employer. If at any point they get sick of the employer's way of running things, they can leave the company. Of course one could say that the 'payment' children receive is food, shelter, etc. but parents are required by law to provide these things, regardless of the nature of disagreement. If the parent provides such things to the best of their ability and has a sound moral character, then I think they deserve the respect of the child. If the parent is doing the bare minimum of interaction, providing the bare minimum of basic \nhuman necessities, and operates the household without the possibility of ever making a mistake, then there is a problem, and I wouldn't blame the child for not respecting them once they are older to think for themselves.",

Further, during that time period, child marriages were pretty common, and it would not have been considered immoral in the slightest to have sex with a young girl once she starts puberty, which is usually around age 11 in humans.  I do not say this as a defense to child marriage, but just to provide some context to the discussion.  We cannot judge the actions of a historical figure using modern ethical and moral standards, because ethics and morals are subjective and change over time.\n\nThe Quran, the central religious text of Islam, does not say that homosexual individuals are to be thrown from the roof.  In fact, there are only [four](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/quran/says_about/gay.html) passages specifically mentioning it, none of which mention a specific punishment.  Of note, this is actually relatively minor to the Bible, which has [extensive passages](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/homosexuality.html) in both the Old and New Testament about homosexuality, and explicitly calls for [death](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20%3A13&version=KJV) to homosexuals.  So, in your words, to be a *good* Christian, one should execute or exile homosexuals.  \n\nThe Bible is also pretty clear on non-Christians as well.  They should be [shunned or put to death](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/nonchristians.html), and that they are all antichrists.  The Bible also says to kill witches, though it does not specify how to identify witches, which was pretty problematic in Salem and led to the deaths of several innocent girls.  The Old Testament is also pretty [brutal](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/rape.html) to rape victims as well.\n\nSomething else that is interesting is that homophobia is not strictly caused by religion.  In [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_South_Korea), LGBT individuals have very little rights, and most of the population there consider homosexuality unfavorably, even though only [54% of the population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_South_Korea) believe in some form of religion, and half of those are Buddhists.  The point I am making here is that it is very likely that even without Islam, many Middle Eastern countries would probably still have some form of penalty for homosexuality, because opposition to it is a *human* reaction, not a religious one. \n\nIf we can live in a nation dominated by Christianity and still be able to pass gay marriage laws, this to me shows that religion is not the thing at fault for oppression and violence.

What if the question was, \"Would you like to be governed in your current country by Sharia law?\" Saying yes, could lead to the above when paraphrased.\n\nThe comparison between Islam and Christianity has already been mentioned. You (along with most modern Christians) have chosen to emphasise the New Testament (and rightly so!), but that doesn't negate the fact the the Bible still presents examples like God telling Saul to \"put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys\" (1 Samuel 15:3, New International Version). You might claim that this is a minor part and modern Christians don't pay attention to that (or other arguments which we can discuss), but many modern Muslims say the same about their religion.\n\n>Christianity (Focusing very much so, as christianity does, on the new testament) is a religion that is almost as pacifistic as Buddhism\n\nThis is your belief as a person (Christian?) in this era. You can't make the same claim for all Christians even in recent history. If you did, then why couldn't a peaceful Muslim make the same claim for Muslims today since [Christians are still killing Muslims.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/10/central-african-republic-christian-militias-revenge)\n\nIt wasn't too long ago that the Crusades killed many people in the name of Christianity. Do you think people from that era would have thought Christianity was as pacifist as you view it? \n\nJesus himself said, \"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.\" (Matthew 10:34, NIV). Every argument you make against a claim that this promotes violence can be made with respect to the Quoran.\n\n\nIn terms of a religion being out of date, how do you define this while not maintaining that all religion is out of date? Wasn't Christianity out of date from the moment Galileo was persecuted because he said that the Earth wasn't the center of the universe? Not to mention the advocacy of Creationism, not Evolution being taught in schools (such as in the US). \n\nIf you go back 70 years, slavery and Christianity went hand-in-hand.

What if the question was, &quot;Would you like to be governed in your current country by Sharia law?&quot; Saying yes, could lead to the above when paraphrased.</p>\n\n<p>The comparison between Islam and Christianity has already been mentioned. You (along with most modern Christians) have chosen to emphasise the New Testament (and rightly so!), but that doesn&#39;t negate the fact the the Bible still presents examples like God telling Saul to &quot;put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys&quot; (1 Samuel 15:3, New International Version). You might claim that this is a minor part and modern Christians don&#39;t pay attention to that (or other arguments which we can discuss), but many modern Muslims say the same about their religion.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Christianity (Focusing very much so, as christianity does, on the new testament) is a religion that is almost as pacifistic as Buddhism</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is your belief as a person (Christian?) in this era. You can&#39;t make the same claim for all Christians even in recent history. If you did, then why couldn&#39;t a peaceful Muslim make the same claim for Muslims today since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/10/central-african-republic-christian-militias-revenge\">Christians are still killing Muslims.</a></p>\n\n<p>It wasn&#39;t too long ago that the Crusades killed many people in the name of Christianity. Do you think people from that era would have thought Christianity was as pacifist as you view it? </p>\n\n<p>Jesus himself said, &quot;Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.&quot; (Matthew 10:34, NIV). Every argument you make against a claim that this promotes violence can be made with respect to the Quoran.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of a religion being out of date, how do you define this while not maintaining that all religion is out of date? Wasn&#39;t Christianity out of date from the moment Galileo was persecuted because he said that the Earth wasn&#39;t the center of the universe? Not to mention the advocacy of Creationism, not Evolution being taught in schools (such as in the US). </p>\n\n<p>If you go back 70 years, slavery and Christianity went hand-in-hand. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_slavery\">Slaves were told to serve their masters as if they were serving God.</a> Not to mention how many churches treat the LGBT community.</p>\n</div>",

I was not suggesting that she **is** the only person to use one, that is obvious to anyone not looking for a fight, I was stating that she is the only person we ever see using one. This is important because it shows that the device was not established at all until it was necessary to their survival. Deus ex machina.

You again assumed that I was trying to prove that Hermione **was** the only person to use one, but I wasn't.\n\n> Well, I'm sort of going on the fact that there is nothing in the book that suggests them being used. I don't think a teacher giving one to a student suggests anything, certainly not that they are in any way restricted.\n\nThere is nothing in any of the previous books to suggest time turners even exist, let alone are used, which could be seen as deus ex machina, making this a completely relevant point. As for the second sentence, you again misinterpreted it to mean they were **not** \"heavily restricted\". I merely said that these \"restrictions\" are pretty loose even if the books say otherwise (which I'm aware of by the way) because they GAVE ONE TO A CHILD.\n\nOh, and your Mad-Eye argument? Think harder \"dude\". His eye doesn't save the day immediately after being introduced, which means there is no reason to scrutinise it. We just accept that they exist, because it's established pretty early. So again, your point is irrelevant.\n\nThat's basically it. I hope that made it easier to understand.

I was not suggesting that she <strong>is</strong> the only person to use one, that is obvious to anyone not looking for a fight, I was stating that she is the only person we ever see using one. This is important because it shows that the device was not established at all until it was necessary to their survival. Deus ex machina. You countered this argument by stating that there are more of them, which is painfully irrelevant to my point. It might have been loosely relevant if I had explicitly stated that Hermione <strong>was</strong> the only person to use one, but I didn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>...That nobody ever uses</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>desperately trying to remind you of my argument in vain. You again assumed that I was trying to prove that Hermione <strong>was</strong> the only person to use one, but I wasn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Well, I&#39;m sort of going on the fact that there is nothing in the book that suggests them being used. I don&#39;t think a teacher giving one to a student suggests anything, certainly not that they are in any way restricted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is nothing in any of the previous books to suggest time turners even exist, let alone are used, which could be seen as deus ex machina, making this a completely relevant point. As for the second sentence, you again misinterpreted it to mean they were <strong>not</strong> &quot;heavily restricted&quot;. I merely said that these &quot;restrictions&quot; are pretty loose even if the books say otherwise (which I&#39;m aware of by the way) because they GAVE ONE TO A CHILD.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and your Mad-Eye argument? Think harder &quot;dude&quot;. His eye doesn&#39;t save the day immediately after being introduced, which means there is no reason to scrutinise it. We just accept that they exist, because it&#39;s established pretty early. So again, your point is irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s basically it. I hope that made it easier to understand. And for the love of god, don&#39;t reply, I&#39;ve had enough of your straw man strategy.</p>\n</div>",

This is not to say that there is no correlation, but just that there is still some distance to go before equality of opportunity can be claimed.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of the uneven educational opportunities, as long as the possibility of private education, tutoring, et cetera exists for those who can pay for it those with more money will still have a better position than those who couldn&#39;t.  The same argument can be used for private healthcare.</p>\n\n<p>Basically I see the family unit and inheritance as structures which are in stark contrast with the axiom of equal opportunity.  I&#39;m not sure what the solution is, maybe there is a better axiom to adopt.</p>\n\n<p>There are many more reasons not detailed here why the concept of providing equal opportunity is not as simple as it is generally presented, even after assuming that money and the ability to reformulate society are no object.</p>\n</div>",

They get funding and direction, but can operate in whatever way they see fit.  The only true means a local government control is whether to dissolve the police force or not by pulling purse strings.  They have no control over non-local governments (sheriff, FBI, State police etc).\n\n>Joes like you and I can run for local government.\n\nI see.  And how does that change the government?

We have polluted the government so far that we still think we can change things, but things always continue to happen regardless of who is in power.  \n\nThink about it for a minute.  There has been a huge outcry against the NSA.  People were up in arms about it.  We called on our government to shut it down, to dismantle it.  We kicked out politicians who supported it.  So it's gone now, right?  Hell, we don't even have constitutional equal rights for all people.  Today, on MLK day, we still have to pass a bill every few years to guarantee the freedom to vote for everyone.  Why does this need to be extended?  Why is there a sunset provision on granting all people the right to vote?  Because nothing ever changes in favor of the people.  We've change politicians.  We protested.  And what happened?  Exactly nothing.\n\nAnd what makes this all the scariest?  There is no oversight.  The government is allowed to hide things from us.  In the middle of the night, you could be whisked away in your sleep and put into a holding cell somewhere.  Certainly your family would call the police and say that you were gone.  But who are the police?  Another arm of the government.  They'll throw you into a giant unsolved bin and continue on tagging speeders, jailing potheads, and writing reports.  You can rot in a cell and regardless of your constitutional rights, you can sit there and no one will know.  You die in a cell, without anyone ever knowing where you went.\n\nIs it more likely that you will be accused of rape that getting abducted in the middle of the night?  Absolutely.  But which is the worse scenario and what should you be more afraid of?  If you piss off the wrong person, you disappear for life.\n\nBut we should look at likely scenarios, right?  If you shoot someone, you go to jail - regardless of how clear cut a scenario it is.  You are guilty until presumed innocent by the district attorney.  The police can hold you, without cause for a full day and then if they have cause, they can continue to hold you.  However, if you are shot by an officer everything changes.  They are innocent until proven guilty.  They don't go to jail, they usually don't even face civil charges unless someone can prove that they did it maliciously.  In most cases, their Union prevents criminal charges in place of them just losing their job.  This is at nearly all levels.  Did that officer think that you were grabbing an object that looked like a gun while grabbing your insurance from your glove box?  You die, he gets paid leave.  Guy looks like he's pulling a gun from his waist and you shoot in fear for your life?  Jail, manslaughter.  \n\nIf you think that we the people can fix the government, why is it so broken?\n\nYou would think the last 200 years  of \"we the people\" would have fixed the problems that the government keeps creating.  If we are truly to blame for the government in its current state, what makes you think that we are capable of fixing it?",

                "body": ">Can you elaborate, what are \"gun free zones\" in America, and how they are reinforced?\n\nGun free zones literally consist of a sign, either on the front of the building (like for a movie theater) or right outside the premises (a university). 99% of the time, enforcement is non-existent. But, because most gun owners are really careful to obey the law due to heavy penalties for gun-related crimes, and not wanting to stigmatize gun ownership further, they obey the signs anyway, or take their business elsewhere. The last 1% are in really violent cities where entrances to schools have metal detectors installed. They seem to me like little more than a virtue signal by democrats. Some states don't give the signs legal authority beyond trespassing.\n\n>What would you say, what kinds of policy changes would you endorse?\n\nEDIT: I agree that there is a violence problem in America. That much is evident due to the 5x increase in homicides over most European countries despite a similar culture. I just don't think restricting guns via the law is the answer, especially since guns are already plentiful. Bear with me, as this may start sounding racey. 70-80% of homicides are committed with a firearm, while over 50% of homicides are committed by blacks. Much of this is then drug related. This **does not** mean they're violent because of their race. However, it's a probable outcome when you combine a 72% out of wedlock birth rate, a high poverty rate, the drug trade; and confine them all to a single community. Things I think would help:\n\n1. This anti-police bias has to stop. Officers have just as much aversion to being called a racist as anyone else. They're becoming so scared of public humiliation, they're avoiding black neighborhoods. Thing is, those are typically poor neighborhoods where the crime happens. It's called the Ferguson effect, after the shooting of Michael Brown; a police shooting in 2014 that was completely justifiable by every possible analysis. Regardless, BLM still heavily protested it. The effect is starting to be statistically relevant, as 2015 saw a 10% increase in homicides. Might be coincidence, might not, but homicides were falling for the previous 8 years.\n\n2. Stop the war on drugs. Seems counter-intuitive, I know. In poor communities, the men are often put in prison for very long sentences due to 3-strikes laws, that vastly increase a prison sentence after 3 offences. This is causing men that would otherwise be fathers to be absent when their children are growing up. The mothers are (sadly) just keeping the kids around for welfare reasons, so the kids go out and try to get money the only way they know how in their community, by selling drugs. Drugs being a very dirty business with lots of money at stake, lots of people are killed in the process. \n\n3. We need to stop stop endorsing gang culture. People are very sympathetic when someone gets shot. When a woman has a child out of wedlock? No problem. When a black woman is spunky and physically abuses her child? No problem. When a suspicious number of black celebrities say they do everything to support their mother? No problem. It'll be hard for me to explain it without sounding racist, but if you have time and are genuinely curious, this interview explains it well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE-urLVdI-8\n4. Federally ban gun-free zones being enforced by states via a 2nd amendment argument. Another hard sell, but it might help curb mass shootings. ~10% of people have concealed carry permits in states that allow them. That's a 1/10 chance on every teacher, movie-goer, or university student to become an armed defender if SHTF.\n>I am not American, so I am not sure what kind of background checks you already do, but I would do endorse something like that. If you are a suspected of terrorism and prohibited from flying, maybe no one should be able to legally sell you an assault rifle.\n\nIt's federal law in the U.S. to get a background check on every purchase from a store. If it's a transaction between two people within state lines, no background check is required except in 10 states & D.C. The NICS (National Instant background Check System) is what conducts this check, and is computerized, so only takes a few minutes. This denies anyone with a felony, drug addiction, or domestic abuse record. I don't know why it doesn't cover terror suspects. The media almost always ignores the existence of this background check though because it's so fast. There are some funny exceptions though: http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/21/reporter-tries-buying-assault-rifle-to-show-how-easy-it-is-fails/",
